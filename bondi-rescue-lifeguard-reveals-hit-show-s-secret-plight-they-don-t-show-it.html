It’s not healthy at all.”</p><p>There are strict guidelines in place for media outlets when reporting on suicide, which includes omitting methods.</p><p>CJZ production company, which produces<i> Bondi Rescue</i>, refuted Kimmins’ claim in a statement to news.com.au, arguing the series touched on suicide “a number of times” over 16 seasons.</p><p>“It’s an incredibly sensitive topic which is traumatic for all concerned, including the lifeguards,” Executive Producer Michael Cordell said.</p><p>“<i>Bondi Rescue</i> doesn’t shy away from difficult stories, but it’s simply not appropriate for us to cover every body retrieval the lifeguards undertake.</p><p>“However, I certainly believe we’ve changed the public’s perception of lifeguarding by showing the mental strain lifeguards experience when confronted with a drowning, or a near death rescue. It’s not all sun, sand and good times.</p><p>“The lifeguards are highly experienced first responders and face challenging situations all the time. That’s one of the reasons the lifeguards are so popular with the general public.“</p><p>Kimmins had earlier claimed the show rarely followed the lifeguards on their own personal journeys after a difficult day on the job.</p><p>“Those lifeguards down there do such a good job of protecting not only the people in the water, but the community. If there’s a car crash, those guys are running across the road barefoot to pull out people,” Kimmins added.</p><p>“Even though they’ve got a reality TV show that runs around it that shows a lot of the goofing off, they never really show a lot of the heavy stuff that goes on, like how we go away and deal with these really traumatic events.”</p><p>Kimmins, who moved back to the Gold Coast last year after losing his job at Bondi, previously hit out at the local Waverley council for how brutally it handled his sacking.</p><p>The lifeguard was one of a handful of regulars to be let go after neglecting to comply with vaccine mandates. He claimed those who failed to show proof of vaccination were dismissed from their role via a blunt email from the council.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“We were on the frontline throughout the pandemic when they made us close the beaches and we’ve been left covered in blood from rescuing people and doing suicide retrievals,” Kimmins told <i><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=950e5f68a3f02c97e8b4aa1f342fe0b4 data-tgev-label=news data-tgev-metric=ev>The Courier-Mail</a></i> in July.</p><p>“To be treated this way is hugely disappointing. I just think the whole thing’s been poorly handled – people should be being kind to each other at this time.”</p><p><i>Bondi Rescue</i> is set to return to screens this year for its 17th season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS%2Fpq3LoquyZaSrfKO7zZ2gZqqVqLC2sYyloJ%2Bdl6qus7CMq5yvnZGhwG60yK1krKCfrMBuv8ScqZ6sXaW5qrPHrWStoJWueqW7za1krKCfrHqqwI6nnLCrXajBsL7YaJxvmZZqg3GDwW2YaZuVma%2BnspZsm2tskmmAcnzBcWhq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cameron-diaz-has-un-retired-from-acting-for-shrek-5.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cameron Diaz Has Un-Retired From Acting for 'Shrek 5'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-bynes-says-blepharoplasty-surgery-gave-her-a-new-look.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Bynes Says Blepharoplasty Surgery Gave Her a New Look</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
