Enter: the best microcurrent facial devices. While medical-grade machines are used to lift and tone during professional facials, at-home innovations have changed the game. Brands like NuFace, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/foreo-luna-4-review/>Foreo</a>, and Ziip (to name a few) have whipped up handheld tools that give similar results. "Microcurrent therapy uses low-level electric voltage to stimulate the muscles in the face," explains board-certified dermatologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/karan-lal-do-325342 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Karen Lal</a>. It feels a little bit like an under-the-skin twitch, but the thought is that it’s like a little workout for your face. The result? A tighter-looking, more sculpted complexion.</p><p>But let's be real: at-home microcurrent devices are expensive. If you’re going to shell out a couple hundred dollars, you want to be sure that the tool is worth the hype—and know exactly how to use it. Below, we’re explaining exactly what microcurrent devices do, who they work best for, how to incorporate them into your skincare routine, and the best at-home microcurrent devices to shop.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-benefits-of-microcurrent-therapy><span>The Benefits of Microcurrent Therapy</span></h2><p>As time goes on, the muscle system that coordinates our facial expressions becomes weaker, leading to sagging and drooping.

You'll always want to start with clean skin. After washing your face, apply the conductive gel that accompanies your tool. The jelly-like activator is key—it helps the microcurrent reach your muscles.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-long-does-it-take-for-at-home-microcurrent-therapy-to-work><span>How Long Does It Take for At-Home Microcurrent Therapy to Work?</span></h2><p>It's important to manage expectations when using a microcurrent device. While consistent use over time will create a lifted appearance, the results are not permanent. If you're looking for a one-and-done solution or dramatic fix, a face lift or injections are likely better options.&nbsp;</p><p>"Most <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g33397545/best-face-massage-tools/>facial massages</a> will decrease inflammation, swelling, and provide some level of lift, all of which is temporary," says Dr. Lal.

"Most practitioners recommend a series of beginning treatments followed by maintenance treatments and the cost adds up."</p><p>While at-home devices aren't as powerful or targeted as in-office facials, they'll likely save you money in the long run. "For people who are persistent, they may prove to be more economical than in-office treatments," Dr. Lal says.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-risks-of-microcurrent-therapy><span>The Risks of Microcurrent Therapy</span></h2><p>Microcurrent therapy is considered <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33584001/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>"relatively safe,"</a> according to 2021 research, and is pretty painless.

It’s larger than most, which means it’s going to cover more surface area and glide more naturally along the chin and cheek contours. It’s also one of the most powerful at-home devices on the market, meaning it’s genuinely the closest you can get to a salon treatment.

Designed by a combination of scientists, doctors, and skin experts, the Ziip is, in my humble opinion, the best in class. It leverages different wavelengths of nano current waveforms to target a variety of concerns, ranging from fine lines to skin texture to acne. Because all the science and tech talk can be ~moderately~ confusing, the brand launched an accompanying app to walk you through exactly what to do. The best part? Results are visible after three treatments.

The prongs fit perfectly along the facial contours, including the brow area, and contract muscles like nothing else. You will want to apply a hefty amount of the conductor gel before you get to work.
