It’s in an idyllic setting, surrounded by an acre and a half of garden, with a gate leading to the 14th-century village church next door. Since Wendy, who is head designer for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.sibylcolefax.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Sibyl Colefax and John Fowler</a>, moved in about six years ago, she decided against making any major alterations, apart from repainting.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Every single room had a feature wall – the guest room had a terrifying wallpaper of tropical birds and flamingos.’ However, she did focus on her bedroom. Three rooms were converted to form a bedroom, dressing room and bathroom.&nbsp;</p><p>Wendy has a flat in London, but spends every weekend in the country, ‘For me, it really is worth the two-and-a-half hour drive. Increasingly, I find it very difficult to leave each week,’ says Wendy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>See: </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/kitchen-ideas><u><strong>Kitchen ideas</strong></u></a><strong> – decor and decorating ideas for all kitchens&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 id=veere-grenney-2>Veere Grenney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uXXkafifong6rPz4DHoNjC-1920-80.jpg><p>When <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://veeregrenney.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Veere Grenney</a> first saw the house several years ago, it hadn’t been touched for 40 years, and was lacking many of its original features except for the 1820 stone staircase. Veere reinstated skirting and cornices in keeping with the period, replaced doors with his favorite Soane-detailed ones and added curved walls to the stairwell.</p><p>Most of the walls are upholstered, 'we do fabric walling in a way that appears seamless,’ he says. In contrast, ‘the house has naked floors, which I love – the walls take care of the noise. I love the luxury around the walls, and modesty of the floors.’&nbsp;</p><p>The pleasure of putting this house together, he says, is that it gave him the opportunity to decorate again in the way he’d be trained many years before.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=paolo-moschino-amp-philip-vergeylen-2>Paolo Moschino & Philip Vergeylen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X9KPPpKUm4y9RrC8fzqUcZ-1920-80.jpg><p>West Sussex was a part of the world Paolo Moschino and Philip Vergeylen, owners of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://nicholashaslam.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Nicholas Haslam</a>, were already familiar with. They had been renting there for two years, and loved it so much that they wanted to buy in the area.&nbsp;</p><p>When they first saw the farmhouse they now own, they’d made their decision even before they stepped inside. ‘The outside was most important, because we knew we could fix whatever was inside,’ says Paolo.</p><p>Each room in the main house has a different character, from the blue and white dining room, and the lofty new extension looking out to the garden, to the cozy drawing room with pickled beams and the sitting room with its terracotta walls, usually used at night. Each room contains an intriguing mix of objects from different periods and places, indicative of Philip and Paolo’s broad-ranging tastes. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 id=nina-campbell-2>Nina Campbell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgX2B73XJYkpi77coSYbt8-1920-80.jpg><p>Throughout the house, which has been <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://shop.ninacampbell.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Nina Campbell</a>’s home for 15 years, there’s a mix of practicality and decisiveness, of warmth and comfort, indicative of her general approach to design.&nbsp;</p><p>Nina has used mirrors liberally and in unexpected places – slivers between bookcases, within and around a fireplace, and framed on a column.&nbsp;</p><p>As the ceilings on the ground floor are quite low, she decided to paint them in gloss, which allows the light to shimmer and bounce off them, giving an illusion of space.&nbsp;</p><p>As someone whose design projects have included a house in Amman for a member of the Jordanian royal family, it is not surprising that Nina’s own home is anything but ordinary. ‘This used to be the studio for the famous sculptor Frank Dobson, who lived next door,’ she adds.</p><p><strong>See: </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/nina-campbells-style-secrets-202226><strong>Nina Campbell's interior design tips</strong></a><strong> –&nbsp;they are as inspirational as you'd imagine</strong></p><h2 id=robert-kime-2>Robert Kime</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMYrTCCSo2xtc656UDowDZ-1920-80.jpg><p>For <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.robertkime.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Robert Kime</a>, every room starts with a rug. ‘You have to start with something,’ he says, ‘and I always think a carpet is the easiest thing.’&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t need to be expensive.
