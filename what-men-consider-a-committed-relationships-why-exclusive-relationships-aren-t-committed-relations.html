If I'm in an exclusive relationship,<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a1322/wasting-time-nothingness/>I can lie on the couch while she does stuff with her family.</a>If I'm committed, I'm doing that stuff with her family. The example Jake and I used was:</p><p>"If I'm committed, I'm picking your dad up from the airport."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

It's the reason that my recently married friend suddenly had a calendar that he and his wife kept in Google that I had to check in order to make plans with him-their lives had become that intertwined.</p><p>To summarize, here are the signs to look for at each stage:</p><p>How to know you're "Exclusive"</p><p><strong>You Agree About it Through Conversation</strong></p><p>Exclusivity doesn't just happen. Usually there's some episode<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2406/how-to-bother-your-guy/>(someone gets tired of the other dating other people)</a>, or a moment (you sit down and talk about it) where you agree that you will be exclusive. In my experience, this is the only way to know you're exclusive: to talk about it.</p><p>How You Know You're Committed</p><p><strong>You've Been Dating a Significant Amount Of Time</strong></p><p>In my head, commitment takes a minimum of 6 months of exclusive dating.</p><p><strong>You've Each Met Immediate Family and Best Friends</strong></p><p>This usually happens piece meal (thankfully-<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a4235/meeting-the-parents-091231/>can you imagine if someone assembled all of their best friends and family for you to meet at once?)</a>&nbsp;Meeting the parents is a big deal.</p><p><strong>You're "Living Together" In Some Form</strong></p><p>You're either going to spend more nights a week together, or move in together.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a1769/living-together-080629/>You'll have belongings at each other's place, like toothbrushes.</a></p><p><strong>There Are Unspoken Expectations</strong></p><p>This is when she's doing something with her family and you know you're supposed to be there, or when someone has to pick up her dad from the airport and only you can do it. This "unspoken expectations" level is<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a5251/women-commitment-100816/>one of the scariest thing about commitment for guy</a>s...because we are lazy.</p><p>Do you agree with me that commitment and exclusivity are different? What are your thoughts? Is it yet another difference in how men and women think?</p><p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://twitter.com/richravens referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>twitter.com/richravens</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaKuVrXqtu9WeZpptZ2uDcK%2FOpqSirJ2au7V51axknrCTocK0tdWiq7Jn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./which-mariners-players-have-recorded-100-rbi-in-a-season-mlb-immaculate-grid-answers-october-6.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Which Mariners players have recorded 100+ RBI in a season?
