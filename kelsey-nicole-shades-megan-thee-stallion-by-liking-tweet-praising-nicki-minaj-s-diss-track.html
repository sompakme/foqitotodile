Of course, she used to be best friends with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>. However, their friendship broke apart after Nicole was present the night Meg was shot. Overall, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">there were a lot of rumors about what happened</a> that night. Based on the rule of law, it was Tory who ultimately shot Meg. That said, there were some theories out there that it was actually none other than Nicole herself. This was ultimately never proven, although Meg and Kelsey remain former friends.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Recently, Kelsey Nicole was thrust back into the spotlight thanks to Meg's beef with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">With the track "Hiss,"</a> Meg ended up launching Nicki into a fury. Over the last few days, Nicki has been working on her response and she has been doing so with a lot of gusto. It is clear she wants to create the best response possible, and fans have been dialed into the whole situation. Well, at midnight on Monday, Nicki launched <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her diss track called "Big Foot."</a> Now, it appears as though Kelsey is giving the song her co-sign.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kelsey-nicole-responds>Kelsey Nicole Responds</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Above, you can see a screenshot where it becomes clear that Nicole has been liking some tweets. The main one is praise for "Big Foot," which proves that Nicole has decided to take sides. "Me going to sleep knowing Nicki's pen game is unmatched! #bigfoot," the tweet reads. Although the Barbz are loving the track, not everyone is feeling the same. In fact, some believe this song is ruining Nicki's legacy in real time. Moreover, there are even people who believe this is a sign that Nicki needs <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Safaree Samuels</a> back. There is a Stan civil war going on, with Nicki and Meg being the two sides.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For now, Megan is remaining cool, calm, and collected. She has yet to react to the new song, and it remains to be seen if she will. That said, stay tuned to HNHH for the latest news and updates from around the music world. We will continue to keep you informed.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
