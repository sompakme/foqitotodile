A representative for Homeland Security Investigations New York said in a statement that the raids were executed “as part of an ongoing investigation, with assistance from HSI Los Angeles, HSI Miami and our local law enforcement partners.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On Tuesday, Combs’ attorney, Aaron Dyer, called the raids “gross” and said the “unprecedented ambush [was]&nbsp;paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated. Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities. Despite media speculation, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way,” Dyer said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“This unprecedented ambush — paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence — leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits. There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name,” he continued.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The events come about one month after Combs was served a sexual assault lawsuit from&nbsp;<a href=#>producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones</a>, who accused Combs of&nbsp;harassing and trafficking him. The complaint was the fifth suit filed against the rapper since his former longtime partner and recording artist Cassie, who&nbsp;<a href=#>sued him</a>&nbsp;in November for sexual assault, said he repeatedly raped and physically abused her for nearly a decade. They later&nbsp;<a href=#>reached a settlement</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cassie’s lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said Monday that “we will always support law enforcement when it seeks to prosecute those that have violated the law. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a process that will hold Mr. Combs responsible for his depraved conduct.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Subsequent suits against Combs include accusations from a woman who was a minor at the time of the alleged assault and a claim that Combs forced Jones to solicit sex workers for the Bad Boy Records founder. Multiple suits also alleged that Combs drugged his victims, and one included a claim that he choked a woman until she passed out, later urging her not to report the incident.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Combs has consistently denied all allegations,&nbsp;<a href=#>saying in a statement</a>&nbsp;last December that “I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BZtqWw2Gajmq%2Bpmr9uu81mqZqhlKh6tbTEq5xmr5GoeqJ5xqumrKtdpMOmvtSsnGanlmK6qrjIrZirsV2hsrexy2adqKqTmnpyfpJub29oaGV9cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eric-bischoff-can-t-believe-aew-put-mjf-at-all-in-pre-show-match.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eric Bischoff Cant Believe AEW Put MJF At All In Pre-Show Match</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./couple-demands-refund-from-airline-after-sitting-next-to-farting-snorting-dog-in-13-hour-flight.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Couple Demands Refund from Airline After Sitting Next to Farting, Snorting Dog in 13-Hour Flight</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
