The impossible burger at Bar Louie is without a doubt one of the best burgers we’ve ever had. Unlike most veggie burgers we’ve tried, this one tasted and looked more like a beef burger – it doesn’t appear to be stuffed with beans, rice, or corn, as most do.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is there a brunch menu at Bar Louie?</h3><p>Bar Louie’s “Weekend Brunch” is reviewed here.
