Overall, she has come through with some very exciting projects, singles, and features. Her fans absolutely love her, and they continue to support everything she does. However, she has not been shy about engaging in rap beef from time to time. Some records and some bars have been speculated on over the last year or so. For instance, it seems like she has a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">back-and-forth going with Ice Spice.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Moreover, she has had a feud with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>. Nicki has her hands full right now as she is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">going toe-to-toe with none other</a> than <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>. Meg dropped "Hiss" last Monday and on Monday morning, Nicki hit back with "Big Foot." Now, "Hiss" is on its way to becoming the biggest song in the entire country. It is on track for #1 on Billboard, which would be massive as Meg has never achieved a solo number-one hit. With that said, Latto is now seemingly taking a side in all of this.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-latto-weighs-in>Latto Weighs In</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thanks to The Shade Room, we got to spot a comment from Latto that was left under a recent Megan Thee Stallion post. In this comment, she writes "U making us proud Meg." This comment may not be an exact declaration, although when you take all of the context into consideration, the message seems pretty clear. Overall, fellow artists have been taking sides, albeit in subtle ways. For now, it seems like the court of public opinion remains on Meg's side. Whether or not that changes at all, still remains to be seen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion are still at odds, and while things have died down a tad, that could change very soon.
