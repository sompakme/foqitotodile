"Women had been told for a very long time that there were very few of us that could survive at the top of the pile," she tells InStyle. "From the time I started 23 years ago as an actor, I think we as a society have taken a few steps in the right direction, but we really need to keep walking in the right direction."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of that necessary momentum comes in the form of women uplifting and supporting one another. The need for sisterhood and mentorship is, in part, why the Quantico star is teaming up with Marshalls for the launch of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Marshalls Good Stuff Social Club</a>, a two-day event featuring workshops, resources, and tools to help women achieve their goals. "It's so important to create safe spaces for women to support each other's ambitions and amplify each other's voices so we can break the myth that only one of us can succeed," Chopra Jonas says. "Just imagine where the world would be if women had the opportunities that would help them achieve successes and be successful in their own individual aspirations."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her field, Chopra Jonas has seen the positive impact of sisterhood firsthand. "I can speak for myself and my industry [as] to how much it's changed," she says. "We're breaking&nbsp;eons of societal suggestions, seeing female producers and female actors creating content for themselves, [seeing] women coming together and creating stories."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As much as providing "a safe space, mentorship, and tangible ways for women to achieve what they want to achieve," is important, Chopra Jones adds that being able to advocate for oneself is another major piece of the puzzle. Self-confidence is key and not always easy to muster up. "It's tough when you walk into a room and you have to find your voice or your courage. It's nerve-wracking," says the actor who, earlier this year, revealed that it wasn't until starring in her latest streaming show, Citadel, that she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>received equal pay</a>. "For me, I find confidence and support in my tribe. Creating your own tribe of people gives you the confidence to be able to walk into a room of strangers and articulate yourself, your desires, and your needs."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When in (self) doubt, Chopra Jonas has a few tricks up her sleeve. Her keynote speech at the Social Club will dive into the nitty-gritty details, but the actor gave InStyle a preview, noting that clothing and confidence often go hand-in-hand. "Fashion is such an amazing gift," she says. "It's really not about what you wear, it's about how you feel when you put it on. It doesn't have to be complicated."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The A-lister's style</a> has changed throughout the years, but the way <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Chopra-Jones uses fashion</a> — to steady, comfort, and express herself — has been consistent. "Fashion is expression. Through my four decades of life, my fashion sense has changed a lot, but for me, it's about how I'm feeling and how I want to feel."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her personal life, Chopra Jonas <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>puts comfort at the forefront</a>. "I usually wear a sweat set with really comfortable, cool sneakers," she says of her at-home uniform, "but it looks put together because I want to come across as put together." On red carpets and at events, the actor admits to having a fashion secret weapon. "Whatever I might be wearing, a good bag is a big, immediate confidence boost for me," she says. "If you can match it with sunglasses, that's even better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Marshalls Good Stuff Social Club</a>, a two-day event focused on empowering and uplifting women, will take place in New York City on Friday, October 20, and Saturday, October 21.
