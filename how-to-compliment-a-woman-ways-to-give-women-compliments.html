His only defense was: "It's my birthday so I am allowed to be ignorant."</p><p>It's tough to remember: Complimenting someone is more effective than criticizing. At work, you often hear about how you can improve more often than you hear: "You know what, you did a really good job on that project." We forget to compliment, but always remember to criticize.</p><p>The previous post highlights&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a4080/how-not-to-compliment-women/>stories representing a fraction of the many times my compliments to women blew up in my face</a>. I developed a list of rules for complimenting a significant other based on the multitude of mistakes I've made:</p><h2 id=1-go-out-on-top-xa0-3>1. Go Out on Top.&nbsp;</h2><p>Once I get a good reaction, I should stop the complimenting because chances are I'll screw it up. In my previous post, I complimented Cara's outfit, then tried to make it better and ended up wrecking everything else. I need to learn to leave things in good order, instead of leaving things destroyed. It doesn't have to make her jump for joy — it just has to make her smile.</p><h2 id=2-don-apos-t-try-to-speak-their-language-3>2. Don't Try to Speak Their Language.</h2><p>It's OK for me to notice a girl looks great, but saying something "makes her hips look great" or "looks like it's from Target," or " I love the new bag" will either upset her or make me look gay&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a1182/sex-single-guy-15/>(and I don't need any more help with that)</a>.</p><h2 id=3-if-you-don-apos-t-know-how-to-compliment-the-body-avoid-complimenting-the-body-3>3. If You Don't Know How to Compliment the Body, Avoid Complimenting the Body.</h2><p>You can go too far, or not far enough. In the previous post, I said my friend had a great height, but it wasn't flattering because&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2540/importance-of-looks-090111/>she must have other priorities about her body she wants to have complimented</a>. But if I compliment a "sexualized" part of the body&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a1590/boobs-080510/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/swimsuits-for-big-busts/>like legs, bust, or backside</a>, it better be perfectly timed and perfectly delivered.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2301/things-men-notice-about-women/>Eyes, smile, and hair are good bets.</a></p><h2 id=4-avoid-tough-situations-3>4. Avoid Tough Situations.</h2><p>There are certain no-win situations when it's impossible to deliver a good compliment, like&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2274/the-perfect-girl-081026/>when I was describing the "perfect woman"</a>&nbsp;in the previous post and decided to include my friend in the description. Also, complimenting a woman when she's mad might just make her more mad. It's not&nbsp;that&nbsp;easy to get out of trouble.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><h2 id=5-avoid-impulsive-complimenting-3>5. Avoid Impulsive Complimenting.</h2><p>The debacle with Cara was premeditated, but my decision to blurt out my compliment about Beth's height flew through the (kind of nonexistent) "filter" I like to think I have. Stream of consciousness is good, but not for complimenting — an insult might slip out.</p><h2 id=6-quot-researched-quot-complimenting-is-good-3>6. "Researched" Complimenting Is Good.</h2><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a3235/little-white-lies/>It might not be sincere</a>, but if you discovered or are aware of something random that someone is proud of, compliment that.</p><h2 id=7-the-golden-rule-safety-first-3>7. The Golden Rule: Safety First.</h2><p>This goes back to the business meeting in the foreign country.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a3126/porn-rejection/>It's best to be reserved and refrain from pushing it too far</a>. A nice compliment will bring a smile. But a poorly timed or badly delivered compliment could be misunderstood and ignite a storm.</p><h2 id=8-my-intent-doesn-apos-t-matter-3>8. My Intent Doesn't Matter.</h2><p>In other words, her perception matters much more than my intent. So, I should pay more attention to how she will perceive a comment than what I intend to say. And that's a very hard thing to do.</p><h2 id=9-don-apos-t-do-it-all-the-time-3>9. Don't Do It All The Time.</h2><p>It's just going to water down your compliments.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2217/when-to-be-special-081015/>It's special if you say it enough, but not all the time</a>. And it's more sincere if you're not doing it all the time.</p><h2 id=10-keep-it-diverse-3>10. Keep It Diverse.</h2><p>I wonder if anyone can ever get tired of hearing the same compliment all the time. Actually, if a girl kept telling me I was hot over and over, I don't think I would ever get tired of it. Maybe I mean: Find new things here and there to compliment someone on.</p><h2 id=11-don-apos-t-do-it-to-get-something-3>11. Don't Do It to Get Something.</h2><p>That's just wrong.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/news/a3918/only-in-it-for-sex/>Guys who are out to get a girl in bed will shower her with insincere compliments as a means to an end</a>. Or a guy might get "complimentary" to his girlfriend before he asks her if he's allowed to head to Vegas with his buddies for a week.</p><p>Have you ever reacted negatively to a compliment from a guy that meant to be positive? And has a guy ever been offended by any of your compliments? What's your advice for good complimenting? Are there certain subjects to avoid? Are the rules different for girls and guys?</p><p>Follow me on Twitter:<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://twitter.com/richravens referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>twitter.com/richravens</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaKuVrXqtu9WeZppsYWV9cLTOsGStp12YvK68y6KknqakYq5uw86mmKdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jonah-hill-welcomes-first-baby-with-girlfriend-olivia-millar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonah Hill welcomes first baby with girlfriend Olivia Millar</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carlito-olivero-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carlito Olivero Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
