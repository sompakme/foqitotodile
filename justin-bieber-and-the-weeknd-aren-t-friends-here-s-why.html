For Gomez, it could have meant getting back at Bieber, who began dating Sofia Richie the previous summer. The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, Bella Hadid, also didn't react well to the news. "[Bella] is hurt and pissed that [The Weeknd has] moved on so quickly with Selena," a source told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>At the time, there was some petty jealousy involved on both ends. When The Weeknd was snapped kissing Gomez in January 2017, Bieber slammed The Weeknd's music, telling <a href=#>TMZ</a> it was "whack." About a month later, he further shaded his nemesis on Instagram Live when he said that his favorite song of the moment was The Weeknd's "Starboy," via <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. He wasn't being sincere, though. Just after making the claim, Bieber burst out laughing. His friend, Director Alfredo Flores said, "Oh s***, that was funny," and Bieber echoed the statement before ending the live video. Also telling: Bieber opted to skip The Grammys that year, where The Weeknd was a performer. Coincidence?</p><p>Of course, The Weeknd wasn't above throwing shade, either. His song "Some Way" — which he dropped in February 2017 — featured NSFW <a href=#>lyrics</a> that seem to be pointed at Bieber, including, "I think your girl fell in love with me / She say my f*** and tongue game a remedy."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlnZ4F5f46jrKysmaN6o7XEm5yrZZGjsW7Ax55ksJ2VoLulecCrnKesXZu%2FqrHNnapmoJWnsrR51qGwaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lucian-grainge-net-worth-how-much-is-his-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lucian Grainge Net Worth, How much is his Net Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-davis-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Davis Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
