The rapper was brought out at the event by his Her Loss collaborator, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>. The Toronto rapper was co-headlining the event alongside the host, <a href=# class=text-word rel>J. Cole</a>. On stage, he performed “Knife Talk” and “Rich Flex.”</p><p>"Dreamville was different," 21 Savage captioned the series of photos. Among them were a pair of pictures of himself backstage with his kids. There were also two photos of himself on stage during the performance with Drake. The two will be hitting the road together, later this year, in support of their aforementioned collaborative album, Her Loss. They'll be stopping in Houston, Dallas, Miami, Detroit, Montreal, Brooklyn, and many more cities beginning in June.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-21-savage-on-stage-with-drake>21 Savage On Stage With Drake</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GA - OCTOBER 19: 21 Savage and Drake Onstage During Wicked (Spelhouse Homecoming Concert) Featuring 21 Savage at Forbes Arena at Morehouse College on October 19, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Cole, who was grateful in response. “J. Cole, if you can’t tell, Raleigh North Carolina and myself we love you, brother, Drake said. In response, Cole remarked, “This man right here, bro, I was such a fan, and I feel like I am speaking for all of us when I say this, bro… We are fucking wowed, amazed, blown away by your greatness, bro. It gives me chills to see you do this shit at the highest level, non-stop and constantly serve us and bless us with the fucking soundtrack to our lives. I am blown away by your greatness. Y’all make some fucking noise for Drizzy Drake!”</p><p>In addition to 21 Savage, Drake brought several other familiar faces to perform. Among them were both <a href=# class=text-word rel>GloRilla</a>, who performed her breakthrough track “F.N.F. (Let’s Go),” and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, who performed “XO Tour Llif3” and “Just Wanna Rock.” Drake also welcomed his longtime collaborator <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Wayne</a> to the stage. He performed “Uproar” and “A Milli.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-21-savage-at-dreamville-festival>21 Savage At Dreamville Festival</h2></span><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoFzhJFmaWplo5bDorPEZqqhmaKawG68yJyqZp6ipLpusNGemKaumaG5pnnFnqqtoaaWuW6txa2cq2Wjqr%2BxvsisnGaZoKWyor7Ap5qe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aaron-goodwin-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aaron Goodwin Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yvette-holland-vasquez-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yvette Holland Vasquez Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
