She won the first-ever TBS Championship and hasn‚Äôt lost it in two years. Moreover, she is already in a league of her own thanks to her incredible undefeated streak. However, it has been very much evident that<a href=#> Cargill is huge admirer of WWE star Charlotte Flair </a>and recently appreciated the hard work she puts into her physique.</p><p>Charlotte Flair has proven herself to be one of the greatest WWE superstars of this generation. Her incredible work ethic and larger-than-life personality have made her a 14-time WWE Women‚Äôs champion so far. Naturally, her Nature Boy father, Ric Flair, is very proud of his daughter as well.</p><p>The Queen is still going strong as she did since day one, currently reigning as the SmackDown Women‚Äôs champion, with a WrestleMania match in her future against Rhea Ripley. Apart from that, Charlotte Flair is also known for maintaining her impressive physique.</p><p>Charlotte Flair recently posted a photo of herself <a href=#>on Twitter.</a> She was seen holding the SmackDown Women‚Äôs title with her chiseled abs at full display, showing her hard work and dedication to fitness as she came back through the curtain after competing at a recent WWE live show in Madison Square Garden.</p><p>‚ÄúWRESTLEMANIA SZN üë∏üèº thank you #WWEMSG üçé.‚Äù</p><p>Jade Cargill came across this photo, and despite having a chiseled and impressive physique herself, she took<a href=#> to Twitter</a> to let Flair know that she was jealous looking at her abs. She also included an emoji to let everyone know how much she loved The Queen‚Äôs rocking bod.</p><p>‚ÄúLook at those abs üòç. I‚Äôm jealous.‚Äù</p><p>A match between Charlotte Flair and Jade Cargill would surely be a dream match given the athleticism of both women. Fans can only hope that in the future if both WWE & AEW are able to put their disagreements aside and open the forbidden door, this match will be able to take place and would surely prove to be a blockbuster.</p><p>Do you think the fans can ever witness a match between Charlotte Flair and Jade Cargill?
