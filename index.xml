But if the gills are damaged or water cannot move across them, the fish can suffocate. They don't technically drown, because they don't inhale the water, but they do die from a lack of oxygen. Can fish drown in too much water? The answer is yes, fish need oxygen to survive just like humans. If the water a fish is swimming in becomes devoid of oxygen, a fish can drown in water; this can frequently occur if you leave a goldfish in a small bowl without a running filter.</description></item><item><title>Could the Red Sea have parted?</title><link>/could-the-red-sea-have-parted.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/could-the-red-sea-have-parted.html</guid><description>New computer simulations have shown how the parting of the Red Seaparting of the Red Sea
