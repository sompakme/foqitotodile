They’re delving into college sports with their new NIL program. Athletes from the world of football, basketball, track and field, and more are being considered as potential future signees.</p><p>The company has already brought in several such employees. Gable Steveson is an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Olympic gold medalist</a>. Jaylen Williams is former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Penn State basketball player</a> who now goes by the name Raelyn Divine. There is a clear direction for where the company wants to go with future talent acquisitions.</p><p>One of those signings may be on the road to disaster. After former WNBA star Lash Legend got people talking with her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Lashing Out” interview segment</a> on NXT 2.0, fans were excited to see her in-ring debut. That debut finally came on the 205 Live show that aired on December 17, 2021. According to Dave Meltzer in the latest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, things didn’t go as planned.</p><p>“I didn’t see the match, but within the company and outside, there was a ton of talk about the debut of Lash Legend which aired on the 12/17 205 Live show in a match against Sarray, who would have been one of the most experienced women on the NXT roster. Even not seeing it there would be a huge size difference. Those who just saw the match on 205 Live noted how it may have been the worst match on a WWE broadcast this year and it was back to ripping on the trainers and such.</p><p>From internal sources, we were told it was one of the most edited matches before it aired, and it was described that they cut it down to 3:00 of “highlights” and it in that form was still the worst television match for WWE this year. Legend would be the most accomplished woman athlete on the roster by a wide margin although that doesn’t mean her athleticism as a WNBA player (although short-lived) and college basketball star transfers to pro wrestling like the athleticism of a Belair or a Flair.”</p><p>It appears that it isn’t as simple as taking an elite athlete and giving them some training. Legend is new to the squared circle. She came from an entirely different sport. With time, she may become a seasoned professional wrestler. Many within WWE are questioning the company’s decision to rush her debut. It could affect the future of Lash Legend.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Do you think the Lash Legend character can be saved after her debut match?
