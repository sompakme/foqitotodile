We wrote 'Ordinary People' together. We wrote 'She Don’t Have to Know' for my first album. We wrote 'Save Room' and a bunch of other songs together.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"So we had quite a rapport, working together, and that was one of the things we tried to take on."</p><figure>John Legend and Chrissy Teigen in 2022. <span class=attribution>Picture: <a href=#>Getty</a></span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>John also gave an update on his growing family.
