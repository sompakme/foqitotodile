Discovery is in talks to produce a brand new adaptation of the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Harry Potter</a> book series by J.K. Rowling. Whilst many <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>fans were left divided </a>by the announcement, already some followers have come up with an idea of which actors will portray the beloved characters in the TV adaptation on HBO.</p><p>New images have been revealed of how fan favourite HBO actors would look if they were cast. The images were created using an Al generator of up and coming stars and current Hollywood celebrities.</p><p>There’s no denying that it will be a challenge to imagine iconic roles such as Hagrid and Professor Dumbledore being replaced. So settle in and grab the popcorn as we take a look into which actors could be taking on the legendary characters.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe expecting first baby with girlfriend Erin Darke</a></b></p><h2>Severus Snape</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26655184.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_unnamed-2.png><p>We all know that the late Alan Rickman was the perfect on-screen portrayal of the potions master, so casting someone else will be a tricky mission. However, Harry Potter fans are pretty united in opinion that Adam Driver is a good fit.</p><p>The Star Wars star does have connections within HBO, having appeared in Girls alongside Lena Dunham. Adam also naturally has long black hair, which is ideally suited to portraying Snape.</p><h2>Albus Dumbledore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26655196.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_unnamed.png><p>The Hogwarts headmaster was played by two actors during the film franchise, however for the rumoured HBO reboot it’s looking like Paddy Consadine will be imagined as Dumbledore.</p><p>The English actor is no stranger to HBO, having just portrayed the ailing King Viserys Targaryen in House of the Dragon. The Al generator gives a good indication of what Paddy would look like with Dumbledore’s signature long white beard and elderly features.</p><h2>Professor Minerva McGonagall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26655219.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_unnamed-1.png><p>The Scottish half-blood witch was portrayed famously by Dame Maggie Smith. Whilst this would be a preferred choice for many, HBO fans are thinking that Edie Falco will be cast in the new adaptation.</p><p>The American actress is best known for portraying Carmela on The Sopranos, and with her distinctive Brooklyn accent, she’ll have to work hard to change her natural voice if she wants to bring Minerva’s character to life.</p><h2>Rebeus Hagrid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26655209.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_unnamed-3.png><p>Everyone knows in the Harry Potter world that the late Robbie Coltrane was the perfect actor cast as the half-giant, half-human groundskeeper, so replacing him will be incredibly difficult.</p><p>Fan suggestions made on forums like Reddit point to one HBO alumni who could be a good fit for the role. The Last of Us actor Nick Offerman, who is used to playing a gentle giant-esque role, has been nominated.</p><p>Using the Al generator, he might at first glance not be a natural fit when compared to other fan favourites such as Nick Frost. However, in his recent demonstration in The Last of Us, <i></i> Nick Offerman can show that he’s capable of portraying warm and friendly characters.</p><h2>Lucius Malfoy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26655245.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_unnamed-4.png><p>Casting Draco Malfoy's father Lucius will be a mission for the series, as Jason Isaacs was a huge fan favourite in the film franchise. However, one recurrent actor who could fit the bill as the sneering character is Alexander Skarsgard.</p><p>Having appeared in the likes of Donald Glover’s Atlanta, HBO’s Big Little Lies, True Blood, and the Straw Dogs remake, the Swedish actor is known for playing mysterious characters and could do well as Lucius.</p><p><b>Have a story you think we should cover?
