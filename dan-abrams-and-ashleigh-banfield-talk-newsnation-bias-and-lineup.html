Nexstar CEO Perry Sook <a href=#>said</a> as much at the opening of the company’s new New York City studio back in April.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“This network two years in is further ahead than both Fox and CNN were in their journey 40-plus and 25-plus years ago two years in, and they had a whole lot less competition than we do these days,” Sook said. “I’m not concerned about the ratings, the minute by minutes, I’m concerned about doing good television — interesting television, smart television — and growing.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For Banfield, a veteran of CNN, MSNBC and Court TV, it’s been a refreshing experience.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’ve worked at several [cable news outlets], and there are guardrails,” Banfield says. “So to be able to work without those kinds of guardrails was just a very different experience and very enjoyable, after being a journalist for 35 years. It’s quite pleasant to be able to use your editorial judgment daily without having to follow a memo.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">NewsNation has tried to walk a fine line in primetime. It is gunning for what Abrams calls the “marginalized moderate majority” in the U.S. who are sick of the hyper-partisan options, but don’t necessarily want a newscast reminiscent of CNN in the 1980s, when it was a wheel of headlines.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The goal long term is to have a level of consistency in the perspective of the show,” Abrams says. “And that perspective is of the marginalized moderate majority in this country who have real concerns about the political extremes and are willing to either call them out or ignore them, depending on which one is more appropriate in a particular situation. But it is kind of stunning, the evolution of a cable news in the last few years, to see Fox go harder right, MSNBC go harder left, and to see CNN die on the vine.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Abrams says that his own perspective has evolved since beginning his show in 2021 (he signed a multiyear <a href=#>contract extension</a> last month).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I may have initially spent too much time trying to balance everything,” he says. “And now I think that I’ve really gotten into a groove where I’m very comfortable taking very firm positions on stories that sometimes the right will like and sometimes the left will like.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The thing I can say without hesitation, is what you are seeing on the air is me,” he adds. “Those are the positions that I take in private conversations. And I don’t worry about being overheard at a restaurant debating or discussing a political topic, because it’s going to be the same point that I’m making on my show.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Banfield, the veteran newscaster, agrees.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I don’t shy away from opinion at all, because I feel like there’s a lot of value to having 35 years as a broadcast journalist,” she says.” I’ve been to the rodeo many times, and I think there’s a hunger for my read on events, cases, verdicts.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There’s a lot I can bring to the table and so I don’t shy away from that,” she adds. “I am also open to being persuaded. Many times I will utter the words — which I remember back in the day you would never think to utter — ‘I did not know that.’ And I think that the wonderful thing about being honest is it shows a human vulnerability and also an intellectual vulnerability that people identify with and appreciate.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Ad Fontes, a media watchdog group, conducted a study last month to try and place a range of news outlets on a political bias scale from left to right. Not surprisingly, MSNBC was “strong left,” and Fox News was “strong right,” with the broadcast networks much closer to the center (albeit just slightly left of center). NewsNation was the only TV channel to straddle the “middle.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Abrams says he regularly hears from people who say “I may not agree with you all of the time, but I love the show.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“That’s the best compliment to me. Even if you don’t agree with me all the time you still enjoy the show, you still know that I’m coming from a fact-based perspective,” Abrams says. “I’m transparent about my views…what you don’t have is transparency on other networks. But you do have it with Chris Cuomo, you do have it with me, you do have it with Ashleigh. In my view, it allows the audience to judge for themselves.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There is no God in broadcasting, there is no voice of God, and maybe that gave people false comfort,” Banfield adds. “But now we’ve empowered a lot more people. They can use their own wisdom and make their own reasoning and judgment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmp52nqLuiwMiopWackaN6oq7RmqSsZZGota2xyKCfZpqRo7OqscudZKKmpJq%2Ft7XEsGRqamNqg3GFmG1raA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fortune-explored-as-prosecutor-in-clinton-whitewater-probe-dies-aged-76.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fortune explored as prosecutor in Clinton Whitewater probe dies aged 76</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ancient-arowana-locations-in-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ancient arowana locations in Zelda Tears of the Kingdom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
