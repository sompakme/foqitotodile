But while viewers won't be able to see for themselves until the film hits theaters on September 23, a select few received an early look at the project during its Venice Film Festival premiere, where an entirely different storyline managed to snag the spotlight — and send the internet into a full-on frenzy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moment in question, which quickly began circulating social media platforms soon after it occurred, took place as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Harry Styles</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Chris Pine</a> settled into their seats ahead of Don't Worry Darling's first official screening on Monday night. Although a viral clip involving Harry Styles seems hardly out of the ordinary, it was the negative depiction of the singer that left everyone scratching their heads.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the video, Styles, who stars as leading man Jack Chambers in the film, is seen taking his seat next to Pine — who notably separated Styles from his reported girlfriend and the movie's director, Olivia Wilde. As Harry shuffled into his spot, his lips appeared to move as he looked down at Pine's lap, to which Pine stopped clapping, shook his head in alleged disbelief, and started to laugh while looking amused.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The internet was quick to dissect exactly what went down between the two actors, with plenty of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>TikTok</a> users claiming that Styles spat on Pine's lap — hence Harry's lip movement and Pine's utter bewilderment. Others <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>jumped to Harry's defense</a> (of course) while explaining that Chris had simply forgotten where his sunglasses were before locating them directly in his lap. Either way, people couldn't stop talking about the moment, and the 10-second clip swiftly racked up thousands of comments, retweets, and likes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, less than 24 hours after the clip's initial release, sources close to both of the actors have spoken out to renounce the claims, much to the chagrin of internet trolls everywhere. In a statement to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, a rep for Pine said any buzz surrounding the short interaction is nothing more than "foolish speculation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is a ridiculous story — a complete fabrication and the result of an odd online illusion that is clearly deceiving and allows for foolish speculation," the rep said. "Just to be clear, Harry Styles did not spit on Chris Pine. There is nothing but respect between these two men, and any suggestion otherwise is a blatant attempt to create drama that simply does not exist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Representatives for Harry Styles also denied the claims on Tuesday afternoon with a short and sweet <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>statement</a>: "This is not true."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It seems, at least for now, that one layer of the incredibly messy Don't Worry Darling drama can be put to rest. But as Harry Styles said during the film's press panel, "I have no idea what I'm doing," and when it comes to all of the behind-the-scenes drama surrounding the project, we really have no idea what's going on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8eaqauxXajBurjErGahmaKnxm6%2F07KjnqtdqL2qwIyopWabmKe2tHnPoqWeZZSku7V51qipq7Fdma6zuMinnmaoopq6qrHRng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-you-clean-a-pier-1-papasan-cushion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How do you clean a Pier 1 Papasan cushion?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elena-neves-fast-and-furious-fan-casting.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elena Neves (Fast and Furious) Fan Casting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
