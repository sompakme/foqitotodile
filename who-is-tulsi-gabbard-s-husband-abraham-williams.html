After the race was won, they met in person, and sparks flew. "About a year and a half later, he asked me out for the first time at a birthday party that a mutual friend of ours threw for me," Gabbard told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/fashion/weddings/a-love-of-surfing-leads-to-a-proposal.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The New York Times</a>&nbsp;in 2015.

He's big on surfing waves, something that also really endeared him to his wife, who shared his interest in the extreme sport. "As we got to know each other, we realized how much we actually had in common," said Gabbard. "Pretty soon, we were going on hikes, going surfing and spending as much time together as we could. Oftentimes that meant an early-morning surf before work.
