The Times reports: "Before shooting began, he summoned her to his suite at the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for a work meeting that began uneventfully. It ended with Mr. Weinstein placing his hands on her and suggesting they head to the bedroom for massages, she said."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Paltrow refused his advances, however. "I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified," she told NYT. She confided in her boyfriend at the time, Brad Pitt (whom she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/news/a46136/brad-pitt-dating-girlfriends-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=dated class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">dated</a> from 1994-1997) about the exchange. Pitt confronted Weinstein, but the producer threatened Paltrow not to tell anyone else.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I thought he was going to fire me," she added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fellow Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie told the Times about a similar experience she had with the producer in the late '90s, around the time that her film Playing by Heart released. Weinstein had "made unwanted advances on her in a hotel room, which she rejected," the paper reports.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did," Jolie told the Times via email. "This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to Paltrow and Jolie, other women—including actresses Rosanna Arquette, Katherine Kendall, Judith Godrèche, and Dawn Dunning, and psychology professor Tomi-Ann Roberts (who acted in college)—also shared their experiences of sexual harassment from Weinstein in the NYT piece.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their statements arrive shortly after The New Yorker <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="published several disturbing accounts" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">published several disturbing accounts</a> from Weinstein's accusers, which included allegations of rape. A spokesperson from Weinstein responded to the article with the following statement:</p>"Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance."<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In her interview with the Times, Paltrow points out that Weinstein's scandal also points to a bigger issue—that sexual harassment must be stopped. "We’re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,” she said. “This way of treating women ends now."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
