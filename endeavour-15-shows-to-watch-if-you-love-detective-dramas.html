Set during and after the Second World War, it begins by following DCI Christopher Foyle in his tireless effort to pursue criminals taking advantage of the confusion the war has created. Later seasons see the detective working for MI5 on Cold War espionage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d976715e79a5-foyles-war-z.jpg><p id=eZ_xXJLR4CEQc data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Why was Foyle's War cancelled?

The series began - like Endeavour - as a one-off in 2012 but proved so popular that it will soon return for its ninth series!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/efbf012e522e-father-brown-z.jpg><h2>Death in Paradise</h2><p id=eyF7he8M2gsXb data-wc=64>Soon to conclude its 12th series, <a class=hm-link href=#>Death in Paradise </a>is a must-watch for those who like their murder mysteries served with a side of sun, sea and sand. Over the years, the show has featured a succession of lovable British detectives who find themselves like a fish out of water when they join the police force on the luscious Caribbean island named Saint Marie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92ba8282c463-death-in-paradise-z.jpg><h2>Inspector George Gently</h2><p id=ebgK5R6gr84YW data-wc=50>Set in the swinging sixties, Inspector George Gently stars Martin Shaw as a veteran Northumberland detective struggling to come to terms with the changes brought in by the new decade. Joining him as his young sidekick is DS John Bacchus, played by Lee Ingleby with an appropriately Beatles-style mop top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39c14aad9a99-inspector-george-gently-z.jpg><h2>Midsomer Murders</h2><p id=egZIanmqwqlUE data-wc=51>With 128 episodes and counting, <a class=hm-link href=#>Midsomer Murders</a> is one of the UK's longest-running detective dramas. The series is currently led by Detective Chief Inspector John Barnaby, played by Neil Dudgeon, who is the younger cousin of Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, who John Nettles portrayed on the show for more than 14 years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f5f9c793dfb-midsomer-murders-z-z.jpg><p id=eJ0f5_3ACydXk data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="The real reason why John Nettles left Midsomer Murders" class=hm-link href=#>The real reason why John Nettles left Midsomer Murders</a></strong></p><h2>Agatha Raisin</h2><p id=ew74n340XVS3x data-wc=46>Emmy-nominated actress Ashley Jenson stars as a PR whizz turned amateur sleuth in this quirky and irreverent series based on M. C. Beaton's book series of the same name. While it definitely veers more comical than serious, you'll love Agatha's unorthodox and often amusing crime-solving methods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/affa48b43383-agatha-raisen-z.jpg><h2>Lewis</h2><p id=e9n8SqArkiS0H data-wc=52>An obvious choice, but if you've never watched the Inspector Morse spin-off series Lewis, nows your chance! Created by Morse author Colin Dexter, it sees Kevin Whately reprise his role of Robert Lewis, but this time he takes centre stage as lead detective, aided by DS James Hathaway, portrayed by Laurence Fox.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dca7f08da223-lewis-z.jpg><h2>Grantchester</h2><p id=eYP1C_MRKmP36 data-wc=72>A Cambridgeshire clergyman finds himself investigating a series of mysterious crimes in his small village in this 1950s drama. While the concept sounds very similar to Father Brown, the two shows are definitely both worth checking out. The series originally starred James Norton, but he was replaced in the fourth season by <a class=hm-link href=#>Call the Midwife </a>and <a class=hm-link href=#>Outlander</a> actor Tom Brittney, taking over as Robson Green's Detective Inspector Geordie Keating's new crime-solving partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7ec61b01c00f-grantchester-z.jpg><h2>Shetland</h2><p id=ezmIOQWYtWWkP data-wc=59>Like Vera, Shetland is adapted from a series of novels by best-selling crime writer Ann Cleeves. Set against a stunning backdrop, the series follows Detective Jimmy Perez who returns to the small Scottish island after his wife dies to take up a role at the Shetland police. Five series are available to watch, with another two on the way.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/505a99042189-shetland-z.jpg><h2>Miss Scarlett and the Duke</h2><p id=ewlDX3syGyH4V data-wc=74>Want a cross between a detective drama and period romance? Well, PBS original Miss Scarlett and the Duke is exactly that. It follows a young woman named Eliza Scarlet, who is left almost penniless when her father unexpectedly dies. Although marriage would appear to be the only option for financial security, Eliza instead decides to continue her father's detective agency - and finds an unexpected companion in Scotland Yard Inspector William 'The Duke' Wellington.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1aff668d604e-miss-scarlet-and-the-duke-z.jpg><h2>Murder on the Home Front&nbsp;</h2><p id=eJd_1_KBc25hD data-wc=38>&nbsp;In this British drama, DI Freddy Wilkins has to discover who murdered several young women. With critics calling it "a cross between Foyle's War and Silent Witness,&nbsp;we think this is definitely one that would suit Endeavour fans!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b1a0331bc796-home-front-z.jpg><h2>A Touch of Frost</h2><p id=euGOfKqFn4M9h data-wc=52>National treasure&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Sir David Jason</a>&nbsp;fronted this much-loved&nbsp;drama as Detective Inspector Jack Frost from 1992 until 2010. The esteemed actor even revealed he would be up for bringing the show back for a reboot. He told <strong>HELLO!</strong>: "If the right script came along I think that we could certainly have another crack at it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/99c2bf273e5a-touch-of-frost-z.jpg><p id=eaAuRWyf-bSIs data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="David Jason opens up about finding fame 'difficult' to cope with" class=hm-link href=#>David Jason opens up about finding fame 'difficult' to cope with</a></strong></p><h2>Murdoch Mysteries</h2><p id=eEvjyVIm4Ge4Q data-wc=56>Looking for a change of scenery from thatched roofs and village fêtes? Why not give Murdoch Mysteries a go. Set in the Canadian city of Toronto in the 1890s, the series follows Detective William Murdoch and his team of officers who investigate the city's gruesome and grizzly murders using the most sophisticated techniques of the time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43267860e73d-murdoch-mysteries-z.jpg><h2>Professor T</h2><p id=eQjmuX9lZxn-b data-wc=50>Former&nbsp;Death in Paradise star Ben Miller leads the cast of this brand new detective drama set at Cambridge University.
