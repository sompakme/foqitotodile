Her debut single, “Love Shoulda Brought You Home” (1992), made it onto the Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 33. While that served as a marker of the potential success of her career, it was “Another Sad Love Song” that truly began that trajectory.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite only being her second-ever single, the song peaked within the Top 10 on the Hot 100 chart.
