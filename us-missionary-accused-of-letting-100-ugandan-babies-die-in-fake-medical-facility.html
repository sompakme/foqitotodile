Renee Bach, who heads Serving His Children ministry in Uganda, is accused of being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of children.</p><p>A US missionary has been accused of lying about being a medical professional while treating children in Uganda after more than 100 babies allegedly died at her facility.</p><p>After leaving Virginia in 2007, Renee Bach set up a private non-governmental organisation called Serving His Children (SHC) in eastern Uganda.</p><p>She is accused of leading parents of children in her care to believe she was a doctor despite having no medical training.</p><p>Bach allegedly took children suffering from malnutrition from local hospitals and "treated" them at her facility.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading

have since emerged more than 100 children died while receiving treatment at her non-government organisation, according to AllAfrica.</p><p>Two mothers have launched legal action against Bach after their children died at her facility, claiming the US missionary was responsible for their deaths.</p><p>Gimbo Zubeda and Kakai Rose, with the help of the Women's Probono Initiative, are suing Bach for actions they believe led to the death of their children.</p><p>Bach's alleged deception is outlined in a statement released by the Initiative in January of this year.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"The mothers allege that they were led to believe that Renee Bach was a 'medical doctor' and that her home was a 'medical facility'," the statement reads.</p><p>Bach was often seen around the facility wearing a white coat and stethoscope and often administered medication to children.</p><p>However, when their children died, the women were informed Bach had no medical training and the District Health Officer had closed Bach's facility in 2015 and ordered her to not offer anymore treatment to children.</p><p>But even after being ordered to shut down, Bach still continued to treat severely ill children who needed proper medical attention.</p><p>"The Women's Probono Initiative and the two women are thus alleging that the actions of Renee and SHC led to the death of hundreds of children amounting to violations of human rights," the statement reads.</p><p>The complainants are asking the Jinja High Court in Uganda to shut down SHC.</p><p>Now-deleted blog posts, which were attributed to Bach, describe instances of where she claims to have rendered medical treatment to children.</p><p>In one post she described how she treated a 9-month-old baby who had been brought to the facility barely alive.</p><p>"I hooked the baby up to oxygen and got to work … I took her temperature, started an IV, checked her blood sugar, tested for malaria and looked at her HB count," the post read.</p><p>Despite this, the SHC has denied Bach ever claimed to be a medical professional or caused the death of a child.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>In response to a 2018 article accusing Bach of "playing doctor", the SCH said: "At no time has our founder, Renee Bach, presented herself as a medical professional, experimented on or caused the death of any child."</p><p>The organisation also stated Bach only provided assistance to medical staff when asked and was only in an administrative role with SCH.</p><p>Since the allegations against Bach have been brought forward, a group called No White Saviors have taken to social media to warn others about the US missionary and bring awareness to the case.</p><p>The group revealed the physical and mental injuries some of the children allegedly treated by Bach had been left with.</p><p>One post showed a photo of a girl with visible scars, claiming she was the child Bach wrote about treating in a blog post.</p><p>"Some of #ReneeBach's victims are still alive. This is Patricia, left permanently disfigured after a botched blood transfusion performed by Renee. She didn't crossmatch the blood, because she's not a medical professional, child had horrible reaction & now lives with these scars," No White Saviors wrote online.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The group also shared a photo of a young boy who appeared to be disfigured.</p><p>"This is Maasai. He has been left with irreversible physical and mental disabilities because of #ReneeBach's botched medical experimentation. Former staff and the family of Maasai report that Renee Bach was the one to treating their child at @servinghis," the post read.</p><p>Bach's current whereabouts are unknown, with reports showing she failed to attend her court date in Jinja in March 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwwdJmpKKro568r63RsmSam5OqwKawjKidZqSVqcGqusZmaGloXaq0orrDmqVmmpGXtqa%2FjJ2gnmWZo3qnrcqeZKadlJ6woriMn5icoZyewbp7uWt9gYh%2BgJeHkLSIkY2IhYOkd5uVgJCAinlk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-started-hydra.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who started Hydra?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-true-story-behind-larry-bird-and-julius-erving-s-infamous-fight.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The True Story Behind Larry Bird And Julius Erving's Infamous Fight</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
