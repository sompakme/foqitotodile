Adams was known for her role as Dina Mergeron on <i>The Young and the Restless</i>; her casting for the part of Beth was announced on November 24, 1990. In 1994 Burnett returned, and had various guest appearances until 2001. Upon her 2008 return, Robin Riker played Beth, who arrived with a "new personality". Riker's portrayal was met with acclaim; Tommy Garrett <i>Canyon News</i> named her "Leading Lady" of the week ending August 29, 2009, along with Susan Flannery (Stephanie Forrester), for their "Epic Battle". Garret said Riker "showed viewers that she is capable of high drama".</p><span>1991</span><p>As a teenager, Beth fell in love with Eric Forrester (John McCook).

In 2003, Gaskill described Oscar as the black sheep of the family, "He's not necessarily a bad guy, but he's not all good, either. He might seem kind of cold sometimes, but I think his heart's in the right place. To be honest I'm not 100 percent sure who he is until I've played him a while. Brad Bell (executive producer) keeps things pretty close. You never know where this guy might end up."</p><span>2004</span><p><b>Caitlin <a href=#>Ramirez</a></b> was played by Kayla Ewell from January 22, 2004 through 2005.</p><span>2005</span><p><b>Gabriela <a href=#>Moreno</a></b> is the daughter of Stephanie Forrester's maid, Helen.

Marcus hired him from a want ad online to find his biological mother. Marcus doesn't really know Owen since most of their correspondence have been online. Owen meets Donna Forrester and is instantly attracted to her. Donna's stepdaughter Felicia Forrester (Lesli Kay) notices this and offers Owen $200,000 to seduce Donna in an attempt to get Stephanie Forrester (her mother) and Eric Forrester (her father) back together. He appears to be intrigued by the offer and tells her he'll think about it. However, after meeting Donna he becomes enamored by her love and devotion to Eric and comes back and rejects the deal. Felicia is outraged and outraged even more when Owen tells Donna what Felicia did. In response to this new information, Donna fires Felicia, Thorne and Ridge Forrester since she didn't believe she could trust them while her husband was in a coma. Felicia was outraged by Owen and slapped him for telling Donna her plan. The Forresters therefore, decide to make it their goal to get Donna out of their father's life once their father comes out of the coma. Owen was made Donna's assistant (detective and paralegal background), due to his growing admiration of her; and he encourages her to keep Ridge, Felicia and Thorne out of the company since she can't trust them. He works as a voice of reason to her. Owen is shown to be a dissembler, causing friction among the Logans and Forresters due to his influence over Donna. Despite their collaboration to find his mother, Marcus is starting to question Owen's motives in regards to his mother. He believes Owen is manipulating Donna and confronts his mother. Donna listens to her son and begins to question Owen. Donna starts to become suspicious of Owen also since he seems too good to be true and becomes concerned when he tells her he loves her. She and he share a few kisses and she decides that it's best if she lets him go. He agrees and leaves the company but doesn't leave Los Angeles.</p><span>2009</span><p><b>Rocco Carner</b> was played by Bryan Genesse from 1987 to 1989. Prior to his exit, Rocco was involved in a love triangle with sisters Katie and Donna Logan, and bought a ring to propose to Donna. In 2009, Genesse returned to the series.

Executive <a href=#>Producer</a> and headwriter Bradley Bell announced the role in late 2009, describing Graham as, "a well-known fashion <a href=#>Photographer</a> who is hired by Steffy to work for Forrester Creations. It soon becomes evident that he has a sinister and mysterious past with another major character." He spoke of Baldoni as "a compelling young actor who will be able to bring forth the intensity that is essential for the character of Graham."</p><span>2011</span><p><b>Beverly</b> is portrayed by Gina <a href=#>Rodriguez</a> since 2011. Beverly was named for Beverly Hills before being placed in foster care and was a friend of formerly homeless Dayzee Leigh.

Hope Logan caught the inexperienced Beverly taking photos of Forrester gowns with her cell phone. Later, when the dresses showed up on Jackie M's runway, Hope and Stephanie accused Beverly of selling their collection to their competitor, prompting Beverly to run away. Stephanie's sister, Pam Douglas, the real thief, felt bad that Beverly was taking the fall for her. Jackie Marone affirmed Beverly's innocence to Stephanie, noting that the intern hadn't worked at Forrester long enough to steal an entire line. Realizing their mistake, Stephanie and Hope tracked Beverly and Dayzee to a bus in Whittier; Stephanie stood in front of it to get it to stop. An angry Beverly dashed into a gated apartment complex. Dayzee explained it was transitional housing for kids who had aged out of the foster care system. Stephanie wore Beverly down by recounting her experience as an abused child, even admitting she'd gotten pregnant and married Eric as a way out of her father's house. Beverly agreed to return to Forrester, then introduced Stephanie and Hope to other residents of the home. After meeting Rick Forrester, Beverly gushed to Dayzee that he was "definitely into" her. Though a jealous Amber Moore threatened Beverly to stay away, Beverly held her own. She later disappeared from the canvas but was presumed to still work at Forrester.</p><span>2012</span><p><b>Father Fontana</b> is portrayed by Luca Calvani in 2012 and 2013.

Taylor Hayes came with her daughter Steffy Forrester (who Liam also loves) and Steffy told him she's pregnant. Hope convinced Liam to stay with Steffy. Steffy lost the baby in a motorcycle accident. Hope and Liam planned to get married a 4th time, and concluded maybe Fontana's a jynx.</p><span>2014</span><p>In December 2014, Maya invited Othello over to her new apartment that Rick bought her.

A mysterious boy showed up with the film to return it. As they began to talk to him they formed a bond with him. The boy, named Zende, invited them to visit him before they left the country. Kristen and Antonio were shocked to discover that Zende had been orphaned when both parents died of AIDS. Zende had lived at an orphanage with his younger brother, but sadly, his brother also died of the disease. To help pay his way, Zende worked around the orphanage and helped take care of the younger children. Kristen and Tony discovered when Zende became too old to live in the orphanage he would probably end up on the streets or working anywhere he could find work. On their return to Los Angeles, Kristen and Tony admitted that Zende had never left their thoughts. They had both been drafting letters to send him. Since Antonio had been battling HIV himself, he felt a special connection to Zende; the couple saw this as the first chance to have a family of their own. They decided to rush back to <a href=#>Africa</a> and start adoption proceedings immediately. They legally adopted young Zende, choosing to give him both of their <a href=#>Surnames</a>. Zende went to live with Kristen and Tony, who have since left Los Angeles (with Zende) and are currently living in <a href=#>Florida</a>. In 2015, after a ten-year absence, Zende returned to Los Angeles and is happily greeted by his uncle Ridge Forrester. Zende decides to follow in the footsteps of his family and is hired as an intern at Forrester Creations, along with Nicole Avant, whom Zende takes a liking to. He attends the wedding of his uncle Rick Forrester and Nicole's sister Maya Avant as her date. When Nicole tells him that his cousin Thomas Forrester unexpectedly kissed her, Zende is not fazed by it. In fact, he asks Nicole out on a date and even gives her a kiss.
