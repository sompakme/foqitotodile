It was the summer of my second year of university and the tail end of a family holiday to Spain. I had soaked up the majority of the book’s romantic drama under the sun, internally screaming at the protagonists, Dexter and Emma, willing them to confess their feelings for one other. I completed the final chapters on the flight home (a terrible idea) and spent every minute sobbing to such effect that my mum was one step away from extracting the oxygen mask to calm me down.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So you can imagine my sense of heightened anticipation when I found out that One Day would be coming to Netflix as a 10-part series. A journalist friend of mine, who had previewed the show, told me to brace for impact for the introduction of Leo Woodall and Ambika Mod as Dexter and Emma. When I watched it on Sunday evening (I scoffed the entire show in one sitting and cried myself to sleep at 3am) it was immediately obvious that the casting is perfection, shifting the barometer for representation in a really positive way, resulting in a One Day retelling that hit me square in the chest.</p><img alt="one day" title="One Day" width=1057 height=689 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/od-103-unit-00207-rt-65b4030fb2a59.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">One Day/Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Growing up, the only time I saw myself reflected as the main character on screen was in Bend It Like Beckham. My brown skin was almost always seen on supporting roles – the best friend or the sidekick, but never the one who got the man at the end. The job of protagonist belonged to a white, often thin, often traditionally ‘beautiful’ woman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But things have come a long way since then. When <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a39672361/shonda-rhimes-advice-creating-tv-empire/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shonda Rhimes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Shonda Rhimes</a> debuted season two of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a39571672/golda-rosheuvel-bridgerton-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Bridgerton class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Bridgerton</a> last year, it wasn’t just the object of affection that was of South Asian descent – it was half the cast, and it was brilliant (if not somewhat emotional, at the age of 32) to see my culture, and therefore myself, celebrated on TV as something desirable. However, the costume design, the plot and the obviously fictional setting still held it at a distance from something to which I could wholeheartedly relate.</p><img alt="a person sitting on a chair" title="a person sitting on a chair" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/od-115-unit-00146-trl1-jpg-od-115-unit-00146-trl1-65cb72de03f11.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Ludovic Robert/Netflix</span></p><p><h2 class="css-19ilr8l e1bddzxd0">'One Day' by David Nicholls</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£9 at Amazon for 'One Day' by David Nicholls" data-href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340896981 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340896981 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340896981 data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"73f36449-646d-480d-bdba-369f484c6984","network":{"name":"Amazon"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£9 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340896981 data-vars-ga-product-brand="Hodder Paperbacks" data-vars-ga-product-id=2efa725d-c2d0-4aeb-9ae5-d37a415d86c1 data-vars-ga-product-price=£9.19 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8bc083f3-3586-4439-a799-697eae0a3579 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Hodder Paperbacks" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=0340896981 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"><img alt="'One Day' by David Nicholls" title="'One Day' by David Nicholls" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1707832537-51aTcOJhqhL.jpg width=651 height=1000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One Day has changed that. Mod is very obviously of South Asian descent and while there are two very small mentions of Emma’s heritage – one off-hand comment from Dexter in episode one, asking whether it’s religion that stopped her from having sex with him, and a smart nod to Emma’s background in the name of the main character (Nisha Halliday) in her children’s book – nothing more is made of it. The truth is that Mod is the essence of Emma: smart, funny, witty, talented and beautiful, she encapsulates the spirit of the character in a way that gripped me from the minute she stepped on screen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In turn, Dexter’s love for Emma isn’t a fetish or a fixation; it isn’t rooted in her heritage or the colour of her skin. It’s the most simple of plot lines: boy meets girl and falls in love (via a few agonising twists and turns). That girl just happens to have the same skin colour as mine – and that’s why it matters. So rarely do women who look like Mod get to be the lead, and even more rarely are they treated as the right person for the role, rather than a diversity hire.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"My brown skin was always seen on supporting roles – never the one who got the man at the end"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="a man and woman standing outside" title="a man and woman standing outside" width=3840 height=2160 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/oneday-firstlook-jpg-oneday-firstlook-65cb72f58e7a9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Naturally, the internet has had a lot to say about the casting of this series. So much of it has been positive, but of course, there was doubt thrown in there, too. Many of the comments I read questioned how Dexter could fall for this version of Emma, complained that the casting was unrealistic, or remarked that the couple's pairing felt “off”. It’s exactly this response that highlights the importance of Mod’s casting in the first place. Interestingly, she actually passed on the role multiple times, citing One Day as one of her favourite books, and her consequent worry that her love of the character meant that she wouldn’t be right for the part. As the casting director, Rachel Sheridan, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.spotlight.com/news-and-advice/the-industry/casting-director-rachel-sheridan-netflix-one-day/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in a recent interview" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said in a recent interview</a>, “she couldn’t have been more wrong”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The essence of Dexter and Emma’s ‘will they won’t they’ saga, played out over the course of 20 years, is a feeling so many of us will have encountered (or desperately wished to). It is the book’s universality that had me enthralled all those years ago – something which had nothing do with what I thought Dexter and Emma might look like, and everything to do with how they made me feel.</p><img alt="a man and woman kissing" title="a man and woman kissing" width=6000 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/od-110-unit-00042-trl2-jpg-od-110-unit-00042-trl2-65cb73613ddb9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The colour of Emma’s skin similarly has no consequence in the Netflix series, as it has little relevance to her character. But to the people watching the show – brown-skinned or not – it stands as an important reminder that love does not discriminate. In order to have progress you need to see it; in order to feel part of a story you have to feel represented; and in order to move past comments that say race defines your success, you have to know your worth as a person.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One Day is beautiful, funny, moving and honest (too honest – I’m still recovering). It does, truly, do the book and the characters their fair justice, while being a shining example of diverse casting and representation in the process.</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1tcG5maoZ2e86nnGacka56ornBoqKaZZ2ksW6wyK%2Bcq6uVYrCiv9OipaBn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./news-and-photos-movies-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>news and photos, movies and more</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./money-has-changed-hands-efe-irele-dumps-olumide-oworu-publicly-declares-support-for-desmond.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Money Has Changed Hands: Efe Irele Dumps Olumide Oworu, Publicly Declares Support for Desmond</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
