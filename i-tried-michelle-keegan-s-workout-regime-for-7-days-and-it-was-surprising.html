Sometimes I used to do it on my own and do 14 miles," she said.</p><p id=eOGnj9do61Cyu data-wc=39>With Michelle an avid cyclist, I decided to hop on the bike for, you guessed it, 14 miles. Now, as my outdoor road bike was sadly stolen last summer, I opted to use the Watt bike at my gym.</p><p id=eOat03UDaxCer data-wc=60>With the resistance up, I put my headphones in and biked. It felt great and what I love about biking alone, is that I can just zone out and be in my own world. Unlike a spin class (which I despise FYI), biking alone is just you, the bike, and some tunes. I can see why Michelle is a fan!</p><p id=eTdcrzAti8n8 data-wc=14><strong>DISCOVER: &nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I'm a personal trainer – and these are the best gyms I've tried</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Sunday</h3><p id=eT_GTnmRV0X_A data-wc=22>I gave another one of Alexia Clark's workouts a go; this time, a dumbbell abs circuit which left my core in tatters.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eqJ9YkCXkuxhu style=text-align:center data-wc=6><strong>Alexia Clark's core workout was intense</strong></p><p id=eSFDo_aSvGpde data-wc=25>It was short and sweet, and I spent the rest of the day resting and catching up with friends. That's what Sundays are for, right?</p><h2><strong>What did I learn from a week of working out like Michelle Keegan?</strong></h2><h3>You don’t need to work out for long every day</h3><p id=e-KNXvdtlmTlN data-wc=59>Michelle's routine proves that you can get an effective workout without hammering the treadmill for hours. The mix of short and sharp HIIT workouts, alongside resistance training, took me just under an hour, which is a nice 'normal' amount of time. I have followed many celeb workouts which have required a hefty time commitment…so this felt like a dream.</p><h3>Resistance training boosts your mood big time</h3><p id=ewwekzOL59Q01 data-wc=13>There really is nothing better than feeling muscles working and lifting heavy weights.</p><p id=eg1UKWZ2OjOCS data-wc=39>What's even better is the feeling of knowing you’re getting stronger. I always recommend tracking the weights you use at the gym or the rep count/rest time over the weeks so you can continue to develop and get stronger.</p><p id=eS3tCDXQ4ZHjv data-wc=25>Plus, it's seriously motivating knowing that the weight you were lifting a year ago is now small fry compared to the weights you're lifting today.</p><h3><strong>Instagram is actually a great source for workouts</strong></h3><p id=epWob8ha-5xvc data-wc=60>With Michelle admitting to being a fan of Insta fitness stars such as Alexia Clark, I thought I'd browse online to see what all the fuss was about. Although there's a lot of nonsense on social media, and workouts curated by those who simply don't have the correct qualifications, there are many, many inspirational workouts and ideas to be found.</p><p id=eLza6XOVQ6iUG data-wc=28>Whether it's a move you didn't know existed or a fun time format to follow, it's worth following some hashtags on Instagram to see what you can find.</p><p id=eB-5oowKi4qem data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
