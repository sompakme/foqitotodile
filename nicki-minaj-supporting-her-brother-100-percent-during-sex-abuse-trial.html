Jelani has emphatically denied the allegations that first led to his arrest back in December of 2015, although he now faces charges of predatory sex assault against a child, course of sexual conduct and acting in a manner likely to injure a child. Leading up to the imminent trial, he has pleaded not guilty. If found guilty of the charges levied against him, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“These are a bunch of lies,” his attorney, David Schwartz, originally&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">told&nbsp;Newsday</a>. “There’s a big, big motive to lie here which I can’t get into right now. But these are false accusations.” Although the lawyer did not give details as to the inner workings of his client's defense, he did speak highly of Minaj, the sister who posted the $100,000 bail for Jelani when he was first thrown in jail. She supposedly used two of her homes to back the money that was posted. Schwartz also stated that Minaj might attend part of her brother's trial and is still behind him "100 percent."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Although Minaj has never publicly commented on her brother's legal woes or given insight into whether or not the accusations against him are true, she had previously posted a photo of the two of them not long after he was arrested, which most took as a sign of support that would continue throughout the case, if and when it did go to trial. In the caption, she wrote: "I would cross the ocean for u. I would go & bring u the moon. Promise u. For u I will. I love my brother so much man. Can't believe I cried during his wedding and his first dance like a punk. May God bless him and his union [...]" You can check out that full post below.</p><p>Nicki Minaj Supporting Her Brother "100 Percent" During Sex Abuse Trial</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoaoJ0fYynoJyjmWK6qrrAo2SsraClvLPAyKeeZqCVp3qjvs6tn56qXWZ9cXnPnqmcnZ6peqXB0aKloGWjmsVurcGuqp5lpKe2oriMp5ywqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./north-carolina-power-outages-could-last-days-after-shooting-attacks-on-substations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>North Carolina power outages could last days after shooting attacks on substations</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-randolph-net-worth-what-is-the-net-worth-of-the-co-founder-of-netflix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Randolph Net Worth: What Is The Net Worth Of The Co-Founder of Netflix?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
