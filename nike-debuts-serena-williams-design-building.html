The futuristic structure—which boasts floor-to-ceiling windows looking out into the city's white oak landscape—will serve as the artistic hub of the Nike campus, where the company's 1,000 designers will brainstorm, collaborate, and create the future of the company.</p><img alt="nike campus" title="nike campus" width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nike-serena-williams-building-06-3rd-fl-forest-floor-garden-c-jeremy-bittermann-1651090956.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Jeremy Bitterman/Courtesy of Nike</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On floor four is the design studio, framed by long rows of hanging fabrics in every color imaginable. It is where artists will sketch, try out different materials, and build prototypes. There is also a more informal art studio elsewhere on campus, where creators can experiment with screen printing, paint, yarn, appliqués, and just about everything else.

Hoke exclusively tells BAZAAR.com that they choose to work with sports world stars who are "changemakers." He says, "Serena is a perfect example. Serena is an amazing human. She's honestly the world's best tennis player, but in her own right, she's an artist, she's a creative, and she's an advocate" for diversity.</p><img alt="serena williams building nike" title="serena williams building nike" width=1440 height=1227 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nike-serena-williams-building-10-retail-lab-01-c-jeremy-bittermann-1651091017.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Jeremy Bitterman/Courtesy of Nike</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her building, he says, is an embodiment of her. "There are lots of Easter eggs in the building … these little discoveries that are part of the design process that … our team did as a way to just remind us of the journey of Serena Williams and her impact on the world of sports and culture. This building is a vessel that I think embodies her whole spirit," Hoke says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While James's building is the research and science center, Williams's building is about product creation and creativity. Hoke says he calls the first the hub of "innovation" and the second the hub of "imagination."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">James's building "is about science, it's about research, everything we can learn about athletes and … what their bodies need." Williams's building is "about serving that knowledge with creativity and creation." The first is science; the second is art. The first is functionality; the second is form creation. That first is utility, the second is beauty, he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The melding of the two worlds is the heart and ethos of Nike: "backed by knowledge of science" and "turning that knowledge into beautiful products that help athletes move forward."</p><img alt="serena williams building nike" title="serena williams building nike" width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nike-serena-williams-building-09-us-open-cafeteria-c-jeremy-bittermann-1651091062.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Jeremy Bitterman/Courtesy of Nike</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From the inside out, the building is a working art gallery, with colorful murals (including many of Williams) adorning key accent walls, custom rugs made by different artists from around the world, wood etchings of Nike prints along the office spaces, large multimedia installations throughout, and different creative "neighborhoods" that come together like branches of a tree in the central bridge, which holds it all together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nature is given equal importance and treated as a masterpiece. Each floor showcases a different type of Oregon ecology. Level four, where the designers are, is high desert. The first floor and lobby is classic rainforest, the top floor offers a city view, and next to a moving video sculpture is a garden filled with Williams's favorite flower: the rose. There is also a natural running trail that surrounds the entire campus, encouraging employees to stay active.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The whole building takes your breath away. Every element, everywhere you go is an opportunity to be inspired. I hope this building encourages people to bring out the best of themselves and to dream bigger than they thought possible," Williams said. "For me, Nike is the ultimate place to innovate and be a designer. To know this building will be the home of Nike's product design and consumer creation teams is incredibly surreal. It's one of the most amazing things I've been a part of."</p><img alt="serena williams building nike" title="serena williams building nike" width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nike-serena-williams-building-07-jenny-sabin-sinewflex-c-jeremy-bittermann-1651091093.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Jeremy Bitterman/Courtesy of Nike</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nature will also play a large role in Nike's current design aesthetic and product development plant for the next 50 years. Hoke tells BAZAAR that it doesn't just stop with searching for or creating eco-friendly materials and trying to lower energy use and waste; for them, it's about "biomimicry, which is trying to replicate nature," he says. "I think we're at the precipice of bio-mastery, which is not just replicating but thinking and acting and behaving like nature. People often ask me who is my favorite designer, and I always say, 'It's pretty easy, it's Mother Nature.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One recently released piece in Williams's collection is a sports jacket created for the Australian Open, which has the ability to keep the wearer warm or cool, depending on the temperature he or she is exposed to. It does this not only through its materials, but through its black-and-white pattern, which Hoke says designers modeled after the contrasting stripes on a zebra, which regulate the animal's body temperature.</p><img alt="serena williams building nike" title="serena williams building nike" width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nike-serena-williams-building-03-entrance-canogar-installation-c-jeremy-bittermann-1651091131.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Jeremy Bitterman/Courtesy of Nike</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jarvis Sam, vice president of global diversity, equity, and inclusion at Nike, tells BAZAAR that it has been incredible to see the work of the underrepresented designers of the Serena Williams Design Crew—many of whom were born outside the United States. "As they're developing, whether its graphics or 3D imagery for the product (footwear, apparel, or equipment), you start to see the impact and influences of things like the refugee experience, the immigrant experience, English being a second language as part of the experience, as well as the cultural heritage, come to the table in the materials utilized and the narrative being told."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Having that melting pot of cultures and perspectives translated through design was one of the most important aspects of the activewear collaboration for Williams, who herself has become a symbol of fearlessness and empowerment on the court; for people of color; and for women everywhere.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking of the athlete's nontraditional (Nike-designed) tennis outfits, which take risks with their cuts, silhouettes, patterns, and colors, Jonathan Johnsongriffin, the company's global creative director of innovation, design, athletes, and purpose, tells BAZAAR, "She wants to bring her whole self to the world of tennis, and you can see that the generations that are coming after her are also adopting this idea of 'I can bring my full self to the court.' And that's really important."</p><img alt="serena williams building nike" title="serena williams building nike" width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nike-serena-williams-building-01-c-jeremy-bittermann-1651091169.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Jeremy Bitterman/Courtesy of Nike</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, as Nike celebrates its 50-year mark along with Williams, Hoke says they're looking to continue "combining the athlete's ambition with Nike's imagination" and, never forgetting their commitment to the environment and to the world's diverse communities and individuals, "rethinking the way we conceive from the ground up."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
