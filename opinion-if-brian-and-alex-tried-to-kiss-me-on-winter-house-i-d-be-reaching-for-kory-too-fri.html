The two are appearing on Winter House season 3 together and fans are going in on Jordan because, apparently, it was crystal clear that Kory had a girlfriend-type situation going on. Some viewers have said they don’t understand why Jordan wasn’t more interested in the season’s single guys Brian Benni and Alex Propson. I hate to say it but, I’m totally disagreeing with Winter House fans over this.</strong></p><p>First things first, Jordan is a total catch – she describes herself as being a combination of “Rihanna and Stevie Knicks” in episode 1. She definitely shouldn’t be crying over any man. But, as a woman pretty close in age to <a href=#>Winter House</a>‘s Jordan, I can totally get why she’d be in tears over the drama with Kory and Malia White.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-10-at-15.36.28-1024x433.png><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winter-house-welcomes-brian-benni-and-alex-propson>Winter House welcomes Brian Benni and Alex Propson</h2><p>Winter House kicks off this October with returning cast members including Kyle Cooke and <a href=#>Kory Keefer</a>.</p><p>Kory is giving off a happy-go-lucky vibe and he’s off the market this season. One key thing to note is that Kory isn’t saying that he’s <a href=#>one hundred percent in a relationship with his girlfriend</a>, though.</p><p>The levels of ‘in a relationship’ vary from Kyle and Amanda Batula being married, Kory being “kinda, sorta” in a relationship, and Brian, Alex, <a href=#>Tom Schwartz</a>, and co being single and ready to mingle.</p><p>Brian is single and tries to kiss <a href=#>Jordan</a> early on in Winter House. Cue example of why Brian may be single (sorry not sorry):</p><p>The Family Karma star says at BravoCon 2023 that he’s “boyfriend material,” holding out his t-shirt in an attempt to hit on <a href=#>Shahs of Sunset</a> star Golnesa ‘GG’ Gharachedaghi.</p><p>Alex Propson from <a href=#>Below Deck</a> is also single on Winter House and he also attempts to kiss Jordan on Day One.</p><p>With the two single guys throwing themselves Jordan’s way, it’s no wonder that her head was turned elsewhere.</p><p>The poor girl <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">joked</a> that she “needs a chiropractor after dodging these bullets.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-d-cry-over-the-kory-and-malia-sitch>I’d cry over the Kory and Malia sitch</h2><p>After the single guys’ behavior pretty much put Jordan off altogether, she shows an interest in Kory.</p><p>With Kory’s confusing answers regarding his relationship and what appears to be a shed-load of alcohol involved in staying at Winter House, it’s absolutely no wonder that Jordan would end up in tears over him.</p><p>It’s totally normal to think there could be some kind of spark with someone you’ve met on a two-week vacay of fun in the snow.</p><p>It all goes left when Jordan thinks she sees her friend, Malia, kiss Kory in the kitchen.</p><p>Malia later cleared up that she was “spitting a drink in his mouth,” rather than kissing.</p><p>But, I can see why Jordan would be upset over Malia and Kory looking close if she was getting feelings for him. Surely, that’s only human.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everyone-wants-what-they-can-t-have>Everyone wants what they can’t have</h2><p>Speaking on the <a href=#>Bravo</a> show, Danielle says that she’s open to “getting reckless” on vacation, and Jordan explains she’s open to a “vacay bae” – she just didn’t think she’d be bombarded on day one by two guys.</p><p>Obviously, Jordan set her sights on Kory. And even Katie Flood <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">admitted</a> that her own type is someone who’s “emotionally unavailable.”</p><p>Kory was giving off “unavailable” vibes but also not confirming his relationship status which leaves a big old gap for a girl to end up crying over him.</p><p>Speaking at BravoCon 2023, Kory <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tells</a> ExtraTV that he was a “dumb boy” for “flirting” and adds that he doesn’t want fans to “hate him.”</p><p>He said: “I’m not well with my words and emotions.”</p><p>To me, this just screams that he can’t deny he was flirting with the ladies in Winter House (even if he and his girlfriend were going through a “weird time”) so all the more reason for Jordan to have caught feelings.</p><p>Kory’s basically confirming he didn’t act in the best way. Not only was Jordan probably confused by his single-ness, but her gal pal in the house, Malia, appearing to get close to him after she said she liked him was never going to go down well, either.</p><p>WATCH WINTER HOUSE TUESDAYS AT 9/8C ON BRAVO</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqLWww9Jopqmhnp68r3nIn2SbqpmWu26tzZ1kmqSVrXq1vsiem2asn2K4qr%2FSZqSeZZ%2Bjeri1za2cq2WYpMK0sYyim2aalWK%2Fpq3CoaCnn12bvLN5yqipsmWkpLw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./so-insensitive-afia-schwarzenegger-sips-tea-after-hearing-of-moesha-boduong-s-health-crisis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;So Insensitive&amp;quot;: Afia Schwarzenegger Sips Tea After Hearing Of Moesha Boduong's Health Crisis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-ciri-s-hair-turn-white.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why did Ciri's hair turn white?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
