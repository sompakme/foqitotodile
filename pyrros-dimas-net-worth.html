However, the political situation in the People's Republic of <a href=#>Albania</a> prohibited him from leaving the country. Dimas managed to cross the Greek-Albanian border at February 7, 1991, after a several hour exhaustive trip. He then stayed in Athens. He acquired Greek citizenship in 1992, and first competed under the Greek flag in the 1992 Summer Olympics, winning the gold medal in the 82.5&nbsp;kg class.</p><span>1993</span><p>With the 1993 and 1995 World titles under his belt, Dimas was the favorite to win Olympic Gold in the 83&nbsp;kg class at the 1996 Summer Olympics, where he was the flag bearer of the Greek Olympic team. He won the event with two new World Records.</p><span>1995</span><p>Dimas is married to Anastasia Sdougkou, a former Greek National Television (ERT) <a href=#>Sports</a> reporter. Together they have four children, Eleni (b. 1995), <a href=#>Victor</a> (b. 1998), Maria (b. 2000), and Nickolas (b. 2009). When he was in his youth, he idolized the former Soviet (Armenian) <a href=#>Weight Lifter</a> of his senior category, Yurik Vardanian, whose son, Norik Vardanian idolized him when he (Norik) was a child.</p><span>2000</span><p>At the 2000 Summer Olympics, he won yet another gold medal, this time in the 85&nbsp;kg class. This made him one of just three weightlifters at that time to have won three Olympic gold medals, the others being Naim SÃ¼leymanoÄŸlu (Turkey, but born in Bulgaria) and Kakhi Kakhiashvili (Greece, but born in Georgia). Halil Mutlu (like SÃ¼leymanoÄŸlu, a Bulgaria-born Turk) would become the fourth in 2004.</p><span>2004</span><p>At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, <a href=#>Greece</a>, Dimas was again chosen as Greek flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. Dimas was recovering from knee surgery and a hurt wrist and was not expected to compete in these Olympics, but he came away with a bronze medal in the 85&nbsp;kg class, becoming only the fourth <a href=#>Weight Lifter</a> in history to win a medal at four different Olympic Games, the third to win those four medals successively, and the only one whose four medals include 3 golds, thus cementing his status as a national hero in <a href=#>Greece</a> and as an international weightlifting legend.</p><span>2008</span><p>In June 2008, Dimas became vice-president, and in October 2008 <a href=#>President</a> of the Hellenic Weightlifting Federation.</p><span>2012</span><p>In 2012 Dimas entered politics as a member of PASOK. He was soon polemical with Greece's policies with Northern Epirus, claiming that the Greek government has "forgotten" it.</p><span>2014</span><p>In February 17, 2014 Dimas participated in the ceremony of 100th anniversary of the declaration of Autonomy of the Republic of Northern Epirus.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1971 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>People from Himara</a> <a href=#>Albanian male weightlifters</a> <a href=#>Greek male weightlifters</a> <a href=#>Olympic weightlifters of Greece</a> <a href=#>Weightlifters at the 1992 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Weightlifters at the 1996 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Weightlifters at the 2000 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Weightlifters at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Olympic gold medalists for Greece</a> <a href=#>Olympic bronze medalists for Greece</a> <a href=#>Northern Epirotes</a> <a href=#>Olympic medalists in weightlifting</a> <a href=#>Naturalized citizens of Greece</a> <a href=#>Greek MPs 2012 (May)</a> <a href=#>Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Greek MPs 2012â€“14</a> <a href=#>Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmegrr%2Bzu9Jmm6Klkah6r7HTZq6oqqSdend8j21t</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./real-reason-rob-kardashian-s-daughter-dream-spends-so-much-time-with-aunt-khloe-kardashian.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Real reason Rob Kardashian's daughter Dream spends so much time with aunt Khloe Kardashian</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jimmy-johnson-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmy Johnson Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
