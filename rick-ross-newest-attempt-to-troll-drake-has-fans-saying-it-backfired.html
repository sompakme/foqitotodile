That makes sense because the two superstars were firing diss tracks off and leaving rap fans on the edge of their seat over and over again. But it's worth remembering that the start of the beef there were numerous others involved. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Weeknd</a> were also all in the mix to some degree. More than any of them though, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> wasn't shy about inserting himself into the middle of everything.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the weeks since Ross has continued to occasionally take shots at Drake. Despite the fact that his disses have gotten far less attention he continues to try and troll the "Rich Baby Daddy" rapper. The newest attempt came during a night out at a club. He was on stage as one of the pair's collaborations played on the speakers. Unfortunately for Ross, fans in the replies took note that the people in the club are only singing along to Drake's part of the song. "Sitting on stage while the crowd sings your oops verse word for word is a flex? Whatever helps him sleep at night" one comment on the video reads. Check out the video of Ross attempting to diss Drake again here.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rick-ross-attempt-to-troll-drake-backfires>Rick Ross' Attempt To Troll Drake Backfires</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Rick Ross continuing his attempts at trolling Drake even as his beef with Kendrick Lamar begins to come to a close?
