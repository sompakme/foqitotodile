While their personal lives are part of the show, the main focus is on their thrilling races. In these races, two determined drivers go head-to-head, with the hopes of winning a huge cash prize. But it’s not all fun and games; these races come with their fair share of risks, including accidents, as seen with JJ Da Boss’s recent crash.</p><h3><strong>Earning Per Episode</strong></h3><p>Ever wondered how much these street racers make for each episode? Well, it turns out that each cast member pockets a substantial sum, estimated at around $20,000 to $30,000 per episode. For example, Big Chief reportedly earns $20,000 per episode that airs.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The paychecks can vary depending on the show’s popularity and other factors. However, Discovery is believed to provide a standard (though unconfirmed) pay of around $5,000 per episode. Considering that many of the cast members already have high net worths, it’s clear they’re pulling in a hefty salary. Another Discovery show, Moonshiners, also pays its stars handsomely, with figures reaching up to $30,000 per episode.</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;Net Worth of Street Outlaws Crew</strong></h3><p>Let’s take a peek at the estimated net worth of some of these Street Outlaws stars. Monza’s net worth is thought to be around $500,000. He’s not just driving any car; his wheels alone cost about $2,700 these days.</p><p>Big Chief is one of the richest cast members, with a whopping net worth of $2 million in 2022. Ryan Martin isn’t far behind, with an estimated net worth of around $2 million, mainly from his success on Street Outlaws, brand deals, and race winnings.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Business owner Robin Roberts is believed to be worth less than $1 million, while Boddie’s net worth is at least that amount. It’s important to note that these figures don’t include their race winnings!</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;Race Winnings</strong></h3><p>Money is definitely a significant motivator in the world of street racing. During Street Outlaws Memphis Season 5 Episode 1, JJ hosted a small tire shoot-out where the winner took home a cool $16,000. This shows that cash prizes play a crucial role in these underground races.</p><p>In the spin-off show, Street Outlaws: Fastest in America, eight of the fastest teams in the country compete for a massive $100,000 winner-takes-all purse. Each race in the Street Outlaws franchise usually comes with thousands of dollars in prizes.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Race car drivers in the USA earn anywhere from $19,910 to $187,200 a year, according to Comparably. It’s a risky profession that involves risking their lives, so the adrenaline rush is not the only reward; the salary has to be worth it.</p><h3><strong>My Final Opinion</strong></h3><p>the Street Outlaws cast members are not only racing for pride but also for substantial paychecks. With earnings per episode, high net worths, and lucrative race winnings, it’s clear that these street racers are living life in the fast lane, both on and off the track.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxhY6tn55lo6m%2FprHTZqaurJyWxLR50pqjmqqZmsBurdGeZJ6ulaN6rrvRnmSsraCav6S0wKuenpxdqbWiuoytn56homKwor7SZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tinubu-s-minister-under-fire-over-high-electricity-tariff-he-doesn-t-know-what-power-is.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tinubus Minister Under Fire Over High Electricity Tariff: He Doesnt Know What Power Is</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-misiak-fan-casting.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Misiak Fan Casting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
