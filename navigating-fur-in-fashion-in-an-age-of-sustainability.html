Brands eventually listened and it has resulted in an almost blanket ban on the use of fur in high fashion, with Gucci, Versace, Burberry, Armani, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Vivienne Westwood and many, many more publicly pledging never to use it.</p><img alt="Marilyn At Ciro's Restaurant" title="Marilyn At Ciro's Restaurant" width=2524 height=2949 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ciros-restaurant-owner-herman-hover-helps-actress-marilyn-news-photo-1568730328.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Frank Worth, Courtesy of Capital Art</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Marilyn Monroe wearing her fur coat</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, we are entering a new age in fashion as a result of the climate crisis, which brings into question best practices for designers in terms of creating collections using only the most sustainable materials and techniques available – with the spotlight inevitably turning to faux fur. Is the replica version really better for the planet than real fur? Should we should be shunning faux fur in favour of fur products that already exist?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is, of course, an extremely complicated question, one which has both powerful moral and scientific arguments behind it. We asked the designers of the Copenhagen-based label Saks Potts, which uses real fur; the faux-fur designer Emma Brewin; and vintage specialists Vestiaire Collective to give us their takes on how best to navigate the topic of fur in a new age.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Is the use of real fur always immoral?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The entire reason that attitudes to fur changed so dramatically in recent years had moral grounding. Anti-fur activists argue that killing animals for fashion is unethical and, particularly when there is an alternative, completely unnecessary. Peta, in its argument against the wearing of any type of animal product, makes a strong case about why it should never be an option.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Animals are not ours to wear, walk on or carry our possessions in,” the charity explains on its website. “Before animal skins reach store shelves, animals live a life of misery, pain, boredom and fear, and many are skinned alive. On fur farms, animals such as foxes, minks and chinchillas spend their entire lives confined to tiny, filthy wire cages.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is difficult to argue against the case that animals should never be killed for fashion, especially when done in such horrific circumstances. However, many designers who do choose to use real fur in their collections argue that there are ethical ways of doing so, and that, ultimately, it is the more planet-friendly option.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sakspotts.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saks Potts" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Saks Potts</a>, a brand that is worn by many well-known influencers and celebrities, still uses real fur in its collections. Despite the negative stigma around this, the designers feel passionately that they have found the most sustainable method for creating their fur products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Natural fur is one of the most sustainable materials available,” the designer Cathrine Saks tells us. “We believe that the future needs sustainable solutions, and using natural fur instead of fake fur is one of the answers to the challenges the fashion trade is facing.”</p><img alt="Pink, Clothing, Fur, Magenta, Dress, Outerwear, Fashion, Textile, Robe, Sleeve, " title="Pink, Clothing, Fur, Magenta, Dress, Outerwear, Fashion, Textile, Robe, Sleeve, " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/saks-potts-pink-1571315971.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Casper Sejersen</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She makes a persuasive point; real fur is a natural material that decomposes into the earth without harming the environment after use, rather than plastic fibres from synthetic products (including some faux fur), which can end up polluting our water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brand also argues that its use of fur is not as cruel as it might seem on the surface.

Wearing any kind of real fur can be deemed to be promoting the killing of animals, or glamorising the fur industry, but with the future of our planet at stake, is it acceptable to throw out clothing or refrain from wearing something you already own, have inherited or bought second-hand, just because it’s made of fur?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to the charity <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/clothing-waste-prevention data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WRAP (The Waste and Resources Action Programme)" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WRAP (The Waste and Resources Action Programme)</a>, the average lifetime for a garment is estimated at 2.2 years in the UK. Expanding the life of clothing by a time as small as nine months can significantly reduce its environmental impact. Real fur is durable and can last for decades. So, particularly when considering vintage fur items that have already been produced, the wearing of real fur can be justified from an environmental standpoint. Using what already exists does not harm any animals and will avoid damaging the planet further through the production of a new piece of clothing, as you are supporting circular fashion.</p><img alt="Gucci - Runway & Close-ups - MFW FW2015" title="Gucci - Runway & Close-ups - MFW FW2015" width=3000 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-at-the-gucci-show-during-the-milan-news-photo-1569599241.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Venturelli</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sophie Hersan, the co-founder and fashion director of the designer second-hand retailer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vestiairecollective.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vestiaire Collective" data-vars-ga-product-id=4c9a81b8-c3fb-4071-b6ac-5ba166a72c7f data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.vestiairecollective.com/ data-product-url=https://www.vestiairecollective.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vestiairecollective.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$380.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=11c41c9d-ec82-4de9-b18a-833f856a3a51 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Vestiaire Collective</a>, explains how giving items a new life is vital and that, although they do have a preference for faux, the site does sell real fur in some cases.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We are naturally in favour of faux fur, from Gucci to Stella McCartney,” she told us. “Nonetheless, we allow a second life to existing items, which include vintage fur.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Is faux fur bad for the environment?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Faux furs are typically made from synthetic polymeric fibres, such as acrylic, modacrylic and polyester, which are all essentially forms of plastic. These chemicals are derived from coal, air, water, petroleum and limestone, which are incredibly harmful to our environment. According to a study from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://oceanconservancy.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Ocean Conservancy" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the Ocean Conservancy</a>, plastic has been found inside the bodies of more than 60 per cent of sea birds and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ecowatch.com/sea-turtles-plastics-oceans-study-2622572557.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="100 per cent of sea turtles" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">100 per cent of sea turtles</a>, which is contributing to a rise in extinction rates of various species.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to this, when some of these faux-fur garments end up in landfill, just like petroleum-based plastic bags, they can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. In comparison, real fur can biodegrade naturally within six months to a year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On paper, faux fur is more damaging to our environment than the use of real fur. However, not all faux fur is created equally. Many high-fashion brands that use replica fur argue that the high-quality materials they use do not have this same negative impact on our planet. But, ultimately, when faux-fur trends trickle down into fast-fashion brands, this becomes harmful to our environment.</p><img alt="Hair, Face, Green, Hairstyle, Beauty, Wig, Brown hair, Red hair, Fur, Hair coloring, " title="Hair, Face, Green, Hairstyle, Beauty, Wig, Brown hair, Red hair, Fur, Hair coloring, " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emma-brewin-1568731249.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Emma Brewin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The buzzy faux-fur designer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.emmabrewin.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emma Brewin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emma Brewin</a>, the woman who creates those well-loved fluffy hats, recognises this, explaining how this relates to her own work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I know that a lot of other brands are starting to do the bucket hats [that I am known for] and I think it’s such a shame because regardless of the processes we are using, some fast-fashion brands are always going to find a cheaper alternative, which is worse for the environment,” she explained.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I wish I could have more of a voice for that, but it’s difficult to control what goes on and what other brands are doing.

Taking this into consideration, if you're opting for faux fur, make sure that you are buying it from a designer using high-end materials and transparent processes – and make sure that is is something you will wear for years to come.</p><img alt="Hair, Pink, Clothing, Hairstyle, Fur, Wig, Lip, Hair coloring, Red hair, Bob cut, " title="Hair, Pink, Clothing, Hairstyle, Fur, Wig, Lip, Hair coloring, Red hair, Bob cut, " width=2075 height=3130 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/resort-2-1568732050.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Emma Brewin</span></p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How do I decide?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not as straightforward as deciding whether you're on team faux or team real (or, indeed, opt out of both entirely).
