Mo Guan Shan refuses and says he can do it himself, but He Tian insists and takes his notebook. He Tian solves the problem for him and explains the steps, but Mo Guan Shan is annoyed and snatches his notebook back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/19-Days-Chapter-439-release-date.jpg><p>He Tian teases him and says he is cute when he is angry, and he tries to kiss him, but Mo Guan Shan pushes him away and tells him to stop. He Tian says he is just joking and that he likes him, but Mo Guan Shan says he doesn’t believe him and that he is just playing with him. He Tian says he is serious and that he wants to be with him, but Mo Guan Shan says he is not ready and that he needs more time.</p><p>He Tian says he understands and that he will wait for him, but he asks him to promise him one thing. He asks him to go on a date with him on the weekend, and Mo Guan Shan agrees, but he says it’s not a date, it’s just hanging out. He Tian smiles and says whatever he says, and he hugs him, making him uncomfortable.</p><p>The chapter ends with a cliffhanger, as the librarian comes and tells them to be quiet and to stop being inappropriate in the library.
