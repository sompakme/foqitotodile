Her new project is called $MOTHER and it is meant to be a way for her to engage with fans. Moreover, it is also a way to make some money. By constantly promoting the coin, Iggy has fans investing in it, which subsequently increases the value of the crypto. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Say what you will about this tactic</a>, but it has certainly worked for some artists.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In fact, it seems like Iggy has some competition. Recently, Hulk Hogan took to Twitter and called her out, saying “You suck at pumping. $HULK has the real milk.” Iggy Azalea then took to the platform and clapped back at Hogan with a photoshopped image of his head over hers. The photo itself is a screengrab from a video of her twerking, which was previously used as a promotion for her coin. As for Hulk Hogan, well, he claims he was hacked, and has since distanced himself from the tweets.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-iggy-azalea-continues-to-push-mother>Iggy Azalea Continues To Push $MOTHER</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Interestingly enough, $MOTHER currently has a market cap of $200 million and has gone up 1,200% since she created it. This has ultimately made a lot of people rich and very happy. With cryptocurrency poised for a big year, it seems like Azalea may have gotten in at the perfect time. However, only time will tell what happens to her new coin. These things tend to dump quickly, although in today's market, no one actually knows for sure.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about Iggy Azalea and her foray into cryptocurrency, in the comments section down below.
