According to reports, he and some associates had pulled up to a recording studio to confront two producers who had "disrespected" his girlfriend, Yailin La Más Viral. Security footage captured from outside of the studio shows them running into the studio, and later making their way out.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He later tried to leave the country on a private jet, but authorities stopped him in his tracks. They arrested him for allegedly assaulting the two men. He was then transported to a prison in La Vega, where he was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">greeted by a rowdy crowd</a> of fans, critics, reporters, and more. Diamond La Mafia, a local artist, claims to have witnessed the alleged assault.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-6ix9ine-thanks-his-supporters>6ix9ine Thanks His Supporters</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"He grabbed both of my producers," the artist said of the alleged incident. "I had just left the studio, Yailin had just left. I was [telling her] I was in Miami and, suddenly, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he showed up at the studio in La Vega and disrupted my producers</a>. Through no fault of their own, without knowing them." He continued, "I was coming down and they were asking where Yailin is... I told them that she had left and they said to open the studio for them and I opened it for them. At once, they entered us. They hit me more than I even know about." Now, 6ix9ine has shared a message with his followers on Instagram, updating them on how he's doing since his arrest.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"First I want to thank God that I am fine," the message, translated from Spanish begins. "Thanks to everyone who has me in prayer... <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I feel so happy seeing you in full support.</a>" His update continues with a promise to provide the people of La Vega with a "gift" when he's released.
