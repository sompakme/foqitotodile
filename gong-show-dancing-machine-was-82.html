He was 82.</p><p>Patton died in Pasadena, according to a spokeswoman at the local Woods-Valentine Mortuary. He had suffered from diabetes.</p><p>The Gong Show, dreamed up and hosted by producer <strong>Chuck Barris</strong> (The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game), aired on NBC in daytime from 1976-78 and then in syndication. Acts — most of them amateurish and just plain awful — auditioned for three celebrity judges, who banged a gong on stage to mercifully send the bad ones packing.</p><p>At a random moment during the game show, Barris would introduce Patton, and the curtain would part, bringing the shuffling stagehand with the painter’s cap onstage to the sounds of “Jumpin’ at the Woodside,” a jazz tune made popular by <strong>Count Basie</strong>. His dance sent everyone on the set — Barris, the judges, the cameramen, the audience — into an uncontrollable boogie.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>“One day, during rehearsal, I saw Gene dancing by himself in a dark corner. The huge stagehand never moved his feet; just his body from the waist up. He was terrific,” Barris wrote in his 1984 memoir, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.</p><p>“[Barris] said I was such a good dancer he had to name me twice,” Patton once said.</p><p>A native of Berkeley, Calif., Patton also appeared as Gene in The Gong Show Movie (1980) and as himself in the film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, <strong>George Clooney</strong> and <strong>Charlie Kaufman</strong>’s surreal 2002 adaptation that starred <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong> as Barris. By then, Patton had lost both his legs to diabetes.</p><p>A former janitor at John Muir High School in Pasadena, Patton in 1969 became the first African-American member of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees, Local 33. “You are a legend in our eyes,” the stage technicians union wrote on its Facebook page.</p><p>Survivors include his children <strong>Bonnie</strong>, <strong>Carol</strong>, <strong>Sidney</strong> and <strong>Courtney</strong>, his sister <strong>Henrietta</strong>, nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.</p><p>Twitter: <a href=# rel=nofollow>@mikebarnes4</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOoJynnV2lrrXAzqdknZ2RmXqou82gZKygn6x6eISQbHBtZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amazon-s-rent-the-runway-store-has-designer-clothes-for-under-130.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amazons Rent the Runway Store Has Designer Clothes for Under $130</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-joy-taylor-s-dad.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Joy Taylors dad?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
