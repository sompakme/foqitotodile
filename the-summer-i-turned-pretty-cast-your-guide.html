The teen show follows 16-year-old Belly as she spends her first real teenage summer in an idyllic beach town.</p><p>TSITP has <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2022/06/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-renewed-season-2-am-1235040754/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>already been renewed</a> for a second season, so it's time to get to know the cast of talented newcomers (many of whom are still in college!). Here's what we know about the rising stars.</p><h2 id=lola-tung-as-isabel-quot-belly-quot-conklin-3>Lola Tung as Isabel "Belly" Conklin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8TyS9ER6n7ePXajKNuYUQC-1920-80.jpg><p>The star of the show is Belly, a 15-(going on 16)-year-old who has spent every summer at Cousins Beach with her family friends. After a lifetime as a homebody who spends days hanging out with the boys and nights at home with the moms, this summer will be very different.</p><p>The Summer I Turned Pretty is Tung's first-ever professional role. The 19-year-old had just graduated from NYC's LaGuardia High School when she was cast, and she's currently an Acting student at Carnegie Mellon University. (She's also a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CK-ORVFAL0M/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>lovely singer</a>.)</p><h2 id=christopher-briney-as-conrad-fisher-3>Christopher Briney as Conrad Fisher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5GEL6s6NrXh8V7wpt5GX3L-1920-80.jpg><p>Conrad is the elder son of the Conklins' family friends, and Belly's childhood crush. Though he used to be the fun leader of the foursome, this year he's more broody, having come off an intense breakup. There's also a lot of unresolved romantic tension between him and Belly.</p><p>Briney <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.christopherbriney.com/resume referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>graduated from Pace University</a> in NYC and acted primarily in theater and short films before getting his big break with TSITP.

He's Belly's partner-in-crime and confidant, and though he always jokes about Belly being his future wife, sometimes they seem like more than jokes. (He's also sexually fluid, in a big change from the books.)</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
