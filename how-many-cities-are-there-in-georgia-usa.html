We Got Cities...Lots of 'Em!</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:68><span>So,</span><span> you've got your sweet tea brewing and your peaches picked fresh,</span><span> because you're thinking about setting up shop in Georgia,</span><span> huh?</span><span> Well,</span><span> good choice,</span><span> my friend!</span><span> But before you start picturing yourself on a rocking chair on a porch swing overlooking a quaint little town (although,</span><span> we do have those too),</span><span> you might be wondering:</span><span> just how many cities does Georgia have anyway?</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:42>Buckle Up, Buttercup, It's a Numberama!</h2><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:72><span>Alright,</span><span> alright,</span><span> settle down now.</span><span> We know you came here for some facts,</span><span> and facts you shall receive!</span><span> Here's the thing about Georgia:</span><span> we like our local governments.</span><span> Like,</span><span> a </span><strong>lot</strong><span>.</span><span> That means there are a bunch of different ways a place can be incorporated,</span><span> from cities to towns to consolidated city-counties (don't worry,</span><span> we'll get to what that means in a sec).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:81><span>Here's the grand total,</span><span> courtesy of the folks over at the U.</span><span>S.</span><span> Census Bureau:</span><span> </span><strong>a whopping 535 municipalities!</strong><span> That's a lot of places to unpack your cowboy boots (or your flip flops,</span><span> no judgement here).</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:70>Now, Hold on a Sec, What About Consolidated City-County Doohickeys?</h2><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:347><span>Ah,</span><span> yes,</span><span> the consolidated city-county.</span><span> Basically,</span><span> it's when a city and its surrounding county decide to join forces and become one big,</span><span> happy governmental family.</span><span> Think of it as a marriage between Batman and Robin – they're both awesome on their own,</span><span> but together they're unstoppable!</span><span> (Except,</span><span> you know,</span><span> for crime and stuff,</span><span> but you get the idea.</span><span>)</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:183><span>There are eight of these consolidated city-county things in Georgia,</span><span> so you might see them on a map and wonder,</span><span> "Wait,</span><span> is this a city or a county?</span><span>" The answer is:</span><span> yes.</span><span> </span><strong>It's both!</strong></p><h2 data-sourcepos=17:1-17:51>So, How Many "Regular" Cities Does Georgia Have?</h2><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:17><span>Alright,</span><span> alright,</span><span> with all this talk of consolidation,</span><span> you just want a simple number,</span><span> right?</span><span> We hear you.</span><span> If you're sticking to just the traditional cities and towns (minus those merged with counties),</span><span> then you're looking at a number somewhere in the ballpark of </span><strong>around 527</strong><span>.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:195><strong>But hey, who's counting?</strong><span> The important thing is,</span><span> there's a place for everyone in Georgia,</span><span> from the bustling metropolis of Atlanta to the charming small towns where everyone knows your name.</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=23:1-23:43>FAQ: Georgia's City Conundrum
