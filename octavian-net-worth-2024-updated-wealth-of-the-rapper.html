Pitchfork also lauded the mixtape for its "daring eclecticism."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-achievements-amp-collaborations>Achievements & Collaborations</h2></span><p>LONDON, ENGLAND - FEBRUARY 28: Octavian performs on stage at O2 Forum Kentish Town on February 28, 2019 in London, England.

Such endorsements undoubtedly played a role in boosting his profile and net worth.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-beyond-music>Beyond Music</h2></span><p>LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - JUNE 07: Octavian performs onstage during Field Day Festival 2019 at Meridian Water on June 7, 2019 in Londåon, England.
