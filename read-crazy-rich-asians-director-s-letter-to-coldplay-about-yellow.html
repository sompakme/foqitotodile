Chu</a>, the only tune that could fit the bill was <a href=# id=auto-tag_coldplay data-tag=coldplay>Coldplay</a>’s 2000 breakthrough single “Yellow.” Warner Bros. was concerned that the song’s title was problematic (the word has been used as an ethnic slur against Asians), but that’s exactly why Chu wanted it. “We’re going to own that term,” he told The Hollywood Reporter in an outtake from <a href=# rel=noopener>THR’s cover story</a>. “If we’re going to be called yellow, we’re going to make it beautiful.”</p><p>Initially, Coldplay turned down the request. Jeff Yang, writing for Quartzy, provides a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">possible explanation</a> for the rejection: The band had previously been criticized for appropriating Asian culture in their 2012 song “Princess of China” and 2016’s “Hymn for the Weekend,” and perhaps wanted to steer clear of Crazy Rich Asians to be safe.</p><p>Chu tried other songs in the key spot&nbsp;— including, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">according to HuffPost</a>, Rihanna’s “Stay” and Sia tracks&nbsp;— but none struck the right tone. “We tried so many other songs,” he told THR, “but everything was about the love story and not about the bigger context of who we are.”</p><p>So the filmmaker wrote directly to Coldplay members Chris Martin, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland and Will Champion, laying out his reasons for needing their song, and their song alone, for the film: “[The word ‘yellow’] has always had a negative connotation in my life … until I heard your song.”</p><p>“I remember seeing <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">the music video</a> in college for the first time on [MTV’s] TRL,” Chu’s letter continued. “That oner shot with the sun rising was breathtaking for both my filmmaker and music-loving side. It immediately became an anthem for me and my friends and gave us a new sense of pride we never felt before.”</p><p>Although Chu can’t say for sure that it was his letter that did the trick, within 24 hours of sending it, the band approved the “Yellow” request. As with several other songs on the Crazy Rich Asians soundtrack, Chu commissioned a Chinese-language cover of the tune&nbsp;— another meta reference to contemporary global identity, remixing culture across continents and generations. The team reached out to young Beijing singer Li Wenqi, who had popularized a Mandarin version, called “Liu Xing,” on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">China’s edition of The Voice</a>, and when she declined, they found <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Katherine Ho</a>, a USC freshman who previously <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">competed on season 10 of the U.S. version of The Voice</a>.</p><p>Read Chu’s full letter to Coldplay below, then listen to Ho’s Mandarin cover of “Yellow,” from the Crazy Rich Asians soundtrack.</p><img decoding=async width=928 height=1201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/letter_to_coldplay.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLOxwJ1knKqRr8Zuvsicn2aZo56ur7%2BMnaCrnZOpvLN50majnqykmr9ur86lm6mkka56urHLpaawZWFmgHaEkW9m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ricky-perillo-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ricky Perillo Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kwame-brown-roasts-nba-for-college-1-and-done-rule.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kwame Brown Roasts NBA For College 1-And-Done Rule</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
