Throughout his illustrious career, Seaver won numerous accolades, including three Cy Young Awards, a World Series championship, and induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><p>But what was Tom Seaver’s net worth?

However, he was selected by the New York Mets in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft as a first round selection, under a compensatory rule when the Braves signed Canadian umpire Bob Davidson away from the Mets.</p><p>Seaver quickly established himself as one of baseball’s premier pitchers. In just his second season with the Mets, he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, posting a 16-13 record with a 2.76 ERA.</p><p>Throughout the rest of his career, Seaver continued to dominate on the mound. He won three Cy Young Awards (1969, 1973, and 1975), led the National League in strikeouts five times, and was named to the All-Star team 12 times. In 1969, he helped lead the Mets to their first-ever World Series championship.</p><p>Seaver’s career also included stints with the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox, and Boston Red Sox.

His first marriage, to Nancy McIntyre, ended in divorce in 1978. He then married Colleen O’Hara, with whom he had two daughters.

The value of his real estate holdings is not publicly known.</p><p>In addition to his real estate assets, Seaver also owned a variety of sports memorabilia, including World Series rings, Cy Young Awards, and other career mementos.</p><h2><span id=Legacy>Legacy</span></h2><p>Tom Seaver’s legacy as one of baseball’s greatest pitchers is secure. He won over 300 games in his career and was known for his impeccable control and devastating fastball. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992 with the highest percentage of votes at the time.

He was widely respected by his peers and served as a role model for younger players.</p><p>Today, Seaver’s impact on baseball can still be felt, both on the field and off.
