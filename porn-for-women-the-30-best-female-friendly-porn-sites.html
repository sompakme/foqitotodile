According to a 2019 study, a full 31 percent of women are now clicking for kicks of their own. Need more stats and data to back this common sense fact up? Pornhub reported that, in 2020, women made up 35 percent of the site's visitors worldwide, which marks a three percent increase over the previous year. The moral of the story: Women have always watched porn and now, thanks to the internet, they're watching more of it than in years past.</p><p>But what if you're feeling frisky, but know that you're more than a little picky about your porn selections? Pornhub might be the reigning king of internet sex watching, it's certainly not the only name in the game.

Whether you're looking for gentle and passionate scenes or sweaty and dirty ones, there's an artfully shot film for you.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-forhertube><span>ForHerTube</span></h3><p><strong>COST:</strong> <strong>Free</strong></p><p>Like other porn sites, there's a mix of everything on this website. But unlike others, it's curated based on recommendations from real female viewers, so there's a lot more female gaze going on under tags like "Amateur" or "Vintage." It's a huge selection in one place.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-girlcore><span>GirlCore</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Access packages range from $1 per day to $7.95 per month.</strong></p><p>GirlCore is a rising star in female porn, and for good reason: The site has very high standards when it comes to production value, a mix of silly, energetic videos that offer a spin on porn tropes and romantic, sensual films that are more reminiscent of other female porn sites.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-bright-desire><span>Bright Desire</span></h3><p><strong>COST: $19.95 to sign up, $9.95 a month after, with other rates for individual videos.</strong></p><p>Bright Desire bills itself as a "celebration of sex" that aims to provide ethical, sexy, smart filmmaking that "move[s] beyond the old cliches" of porn.

Vivid-Ed is a division of Vivid Entertainment, but the site itself is run by sex educator and podcaster Tristan Taormino and promises to bring visitors "sex ed videos that are smart, sexy, educational and entertaining."</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-dipsea><span>Dipsea</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Free trial, then $12.99/month or $59.99 for the year</strong></p><p>Another entry into the exciting world of audio porn, Dipsea is a female-founded startup that focuses on storytelling to get you in the mood.

"We are proud to feature filmmakers and performers who are committed to pleasure, diversity, and serious fun," Jackie Strano, the company's executive vice president,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://goodvibesblog.com/good-vibrations-after-dark-feminist-porn-on-demand/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>explains</a>.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-x-confessions><span>X Confessions</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Staggered memberships, from $34.99 a month for a month-to-month membership to $143.40 a year for a yearly subscription.</strong></p><p>The answer for women who crave real, intimate porn that's not just a male gaze-y tangle of limbs and orifices, XConfessions was created by awesome women who wanted an outlet for&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a20471/how-female-filmmakers-are-reinventing-porn-for-stylish-women/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>porn that's ethical</a>&nbsp;and diverse. The member-only site provided a grant to 10 female directors to film their sexual fantasies and the response was a series of short porn videos shot with a sensual, emotional approach to great sex (and did we mention how cinematic they are?). Grab the popcorn and a vibe.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-frolicme><span>FrolicMe</span></h3><p><strong>Cost: Erotic stories are free to read, and subscriptions are available for video.</strong></p><p>This site has everything you could ever want when it comes to erotic content. It has stories, videos, and even audio porn (bite-sized erotic stories you can listen to). The films are made in-house and 100 percent ethically made. They are as founder and director, Anna Richards, says, made by someone who loves film-making with actors who actually want to work together. This is your one-stop shop for all things sexy.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-ersties><span>Ersties</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Several packages, starting at $35 a month.</strong></p><p>Ersties is a Danish-run erotica site that's by women and for women and feels like what you would get if a porn site were also an online haven for female friendship and solidarity.

From gang-bangs, to romance, to rough sex, there is something for everyone. It features a ridiculous amount of high res videos with a wide arrange of actors and sex acts. It playfully calls itself “curated smut.”</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-hot-movies-for-her><span>Hot Movies For Her</span></h3><p><strong>COST:&nbsp;Roughly 14 cents a minute—but larger packages come with free minutes and new users get 20&nbsp;</strong><strong>free</strong><strong>&nbsp;minutes to try out the site.</strong></p><p>As the name suggests, this one's for us. Endorsed by postfem mag&nbsp;Bust,&nbsp;this site presents a mind-boggling 65,000 movies. All can be viewed full-screen, in good quality. The best we saw was a classic from '70s porn auteur Roberta Findlay—there's just something about a burly, hairy man in massive aviators and head-to-toe Wrangler....Sorry—TMI?</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-lady-cheeky><span>Lady Cheeky</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Free when you sign up.</strong></p><p>Remember when Tumblr had all the best porn, only to be SAVAGELY taken down?

It'll get you going, we promise.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-x-art><span>X-Art</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Various plans, starting at $39.95 a month.</strong></p><p>Like the name suggests, X-Art offers members a collection of truly beautiful and, well, artistic, erotica. The site's videos are all HD quality and the offerings include a range of erotic pleasures, from standard couple sex to threesomes, toy play, and beyond.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-literotica><span>Literotica</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Free</strong></p><p>This site makes Nora Roberts look like Dr. Seuss. With hundreds of free erotic stories, there's something for every fetish (alien sex, anyone?). Think you can do better? Let your inner Jenna Jameson run wild and submit your own typed porn. Bonus: If you're tired of "BrickBreaker," click on free games and play "XXXMan," where a not-so-coy Ms. Pac Man type chomps up tiny penises instead of ghosts. Talk about a man-eater!</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-adult-dvd-talk><span>Adult DVD Talk</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Free</strong></p><p>One-stop shopping for porn geeks. As if 15,000 reviews of 48 varieties of porn (and space for you to submit your own critiques) weren't enough to keep you busy, this site also has interviews and podcasts with porn stars and directors, a weekly newsletter, and sale alerts. More for guiding your rental fun than providing it, it's way better than the back room at your local video store. Plus, half the pleasure comes from scrolling through the lists for cheesy titles. Our favorite?&nbsp;The Da Vinci Load.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-i-feel-myself><span>I Feel Myself</span></h3><p><strong>COST: From $29.95/month</strong></p><p>Call us shameless voyeurs, but these videos of women caught in the (mainly solo) act made us want to grab our own&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/g3274/most-popular-vibrators-reviewed/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/best-vibrators/>battery-powered devices</a>. Artfully shot using natural-looking participants, the site is a multimedia homage to the beauty and power of female orgasm. But a women's-studies dissertation it is not: The clips, divided into "solo" and "friend" categories, are explicit and hot. "O" yeah.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-kink><span>Kink</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Starting at $19.99/month</strong></p><p>Hard-core video action divided into a dazzling array of special-interest categories (HogTied.com, MeninPain.com, WhippedAss.com...). If "kink" conjures up quirky, vaguely racy images for you, prepare for a shock to the you-know-what. We found the clit clamps, strap-ons, and anal inserts a bit intimidating, but enthusiasts rave about the site's "respectful and positive" approach to BDSM play. We agree, master.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-red-light-center><span>Red Light Center</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Free to enter; $20/month for VIP membership</strong></p><p>Second Life fanatics will recognize this setup, where you go through a virtual world with a character based loosely on yourself, to interact—and we do mean interact—with other avatars. Just note: Your cheap thrills will cost you. It's free to scroll, but only paying VIPs can drop their clothes. Once again, art imitates life.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-joy-bear><span>Joy Bear</span></h3><p><strong>COST: Various plans, starting at $16.67 for multi-month plans.</strong></p><p>JoyBear bills itself as "very British" and "very naughty" and it delivers on both counts.
