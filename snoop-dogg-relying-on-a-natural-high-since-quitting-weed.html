"Please respect my privacy at this time." Now, he's hopped on Instagram once again, updating fans on how the process is going. He posted a sleepy, black-and-white selfie, captioning the photo "natural high." From the looks of things, the hitmaker is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">having a tough go at the moment</a>.

Coi Leray, for example, hopped on board shortly after his announcement, claiming that she plans to quit smoking after Thanksgiving. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Meek Mill</a> also followed suit, noting the different <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">health issues</a> he's trying to mitigate by quitting. "Ima go to Dubai and completely stop smoking," he declared on Twitter. "Ima follow snoop, my doctor said I got a lil bit emphysema in a chest if I don’t stop smoking it cuts my lifeline in half. I was addicted to the nicotine and this new weed got too many chemicals and too risky to play with my mental!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Snoop Dogg deciding to quit smoking weed?
