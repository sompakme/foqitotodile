Channing has forged a career on essentially being our dream man – he can dance, he’s funny, and he has that body - but in , he added to that by showing off his senstive side.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">DEAR JOHN - Official Trailer (HD)</a><p id=ek_udahUH5hEL data-wc=7><strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;(2012) and <a class=hm-link href=#>Zac Efron</a></strong></p><p id=eTuOhRClSVSkq data-wc=73>follows a Marine soldier, Logan Thibault, who finds a misplaced photo of a mystery woman and decides to keep it, seeing it as his lucky charm after narrowly avoiding a number of attacks. It stars Zac Efron as said Logan, who upon his return home, he decides to find his ‘guardian angel’. With plenty of six-pack shots to go around, saw Zac turn into a full-fledged hottie.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><p id=eMS5J6ZpPSC2O data-wc=7><strong>(2010) and<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Liam Hemsworth</a></strong></p><p id=eD3AjuN32hTZR data-wc=100>is based around Ronnie, a teenage rebel and talented pianist, sent to stay with her estranged father on the shores of North Carolina. It's here that she meets local good boy Will, who seems to be able to keep her grounded. The film’s stars (<a class=hm-link href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> and Liam Hemsworth) found love on set, but alas, their romance was not as lasting as their fictional counterparts. Australian hunk Liam took the lead in , and he's since shot to fame as rebel warrior Gale in , where's he's also proved his formidable action skills.</p><p id=eYjNqvoubU7rw data-wc=6><strong>2004) and <a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Gosling</a></strong></p><p id=e504k2NJhuaT6 data-wc=83>is arguably Nicholas’s seminal work - a romantic drama of two lovers in 1940 separated by social and financial differences, narrated in the present day by an elderly man to a fellow nursing home patient. Possibly the most well known of Nicholas’s novels, this love story is still known to bring grown men to tears. Ryan Gosling’s character Noah is an ultimate dream babe. He looks like Ryan Gosling, and he writes every day. You don’t get better than that really.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">The Notebook - Trailer</a><p id=eOT4GfujtxNEi data-wc=8><strong>(2002) and Shane West</strong></p><p id=edC5ETZNKf6hN data-wc=85>Way before left viewers in emotional pieces, and 12 years before made them sob with its account of love in the time of terminal illness, there was , starring Shane West and <a class=hm-link href=#>Mandy Moore</a>.
