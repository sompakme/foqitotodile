In it, Celly and Geesy trade bars over a menacing piano loop, sharp drums, and a grandiose vocal sample. Moreover, it's Celly's most high-profile single in a while. Last we heard from him on HNHH, he collaborated with Mozzy and E Mozzy for the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">H.G.M</a>. mixtape.</p><p>SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 12: OhGeesy performs during Rolling Loud at NOS Events Center on December 12, 2021 in San Bernardino, California. (Photo by Timothy Norris/WireImage)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While this is one of Celly's most notable releases in a while, the Sacramento rapper has been putting in work consistently. He already threw his name in the ring this year with the E Mozzy collab tape Middle East. Moreover, his hustle resulted in increasingly confident verses, better beat selection, and overall upward trajectory. Sure, we're used to hearing Celly <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">collaborate</a> with Mozzy and company quite often, but to link with Geesy is another treat in and of itself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Instrumentally, each element of this track is effectively understated. Still, the focus is on the bars and flows, although the beat has some creative details that make it dynamic. For example, the main piano lines go up in pitch as the flows switch up, and there are more melodic elements than the track lets on. Atmospheric and almost opera-like vocal samples, an extra key line, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Geesy's catchy hook</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, it doesn't make the song feel any less cold-blooded. As Celly and his featured L.A. guest go through their performance. there's a husk to each of their voices. Meanwhile, the sharp hi-hats and snares contrast well with the dreamy texture of the instrumental. Lyrically, there's a lot of debauchery and hedonism to talk about, whether it's their money-making exploits or their relationship to others in their circle. What's clear is that Celly adds a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">slightly faster, more dramatic approach</a> to this Southern sound.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What did you think of Celly Ru's latest track, "Hush" featuring OhGeesy?

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZ313gpJmmp6knK56s8GMq5ylnZGosrR5x66qoWWnnsGpec6hnp6do64%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-glenn-bennett-mobygames.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Glenn Bennett - MobyGames</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./autumn-phillips-steps-out-with-partner-donal-mulryan-at-cheltenham.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Autumn Phillips steps out with partner Donal Mulryan at Cheltenham</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
