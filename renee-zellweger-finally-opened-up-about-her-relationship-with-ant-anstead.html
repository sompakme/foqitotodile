When she was grieving the loss of her friend and publicist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="noopener nofollow">Nanci Ryder</a>, the actress said that she was hoping for a distraction when she caught an episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity IOU</a> that featured her pal, Brad Pitt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was around Judy," Zellweger told Bazaar. "Late night, and I remember I watched the Property Brothers with Brad Pitt."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She felt inspired to help out and thank the nurses that cared for Ryder, Jerome and Jerald Cowan. When she found out that there was a spin-off planned for Celebrity IOU involving cars, she knew she wanted to get involved — and that's how she met her new boyfriend Ant Anstead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Yeah, we do joke about that," Zellweger said of the idea that Ryder brought the couple together. "She's always doing her best. It made me smile. It made me smile to think on this, yeah, the serendipity of it all."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zellweger and Anstead met in June 2021 and started dating shortly after, making their first official appearance as a couple in August. The two have been spotted throughout Los Angeles and Orange County ever since, with Zellweger and Anstead making appearances at the beach and parks together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There is so much respect between them," a source told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in September 2021. "They spend as much time as possible together when they aren't working on other projects. They truly like each other as well as their romantic attraction. The relationship is serious."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while this is the first time Zellweger has spoken about the relationship, Anstead has shared his feelings — and how he owes it all to the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm really grateful to the show because these amazing things happen in your world and sometimes when things collide, they collide at the most obscure times when you least expect them. And that's what happened in this case," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">he said</a>. "I"m grateful for that [...] Renée and my relationship is something that's really private. It's something I'm not really willing to talk too much about. It's really early in our relationship and I don't want to put any pressure on that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9GepZ6dXa%2ByrbjWnp6eql%2Bnsq%2BxxGaxnqScrLKosdFmmKesXZa7tMDEmptmoJGnvaa%2B0maZmrKRlr9ur86mpJ6mpKg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./song.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>song</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kodak-black-embraces-religious-imagery-in-testimony-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kodak Black Embraces Religious Imagery In &amp;quot;Testimony&amp;quot; Video</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-baby-is-innocent-little-boy-eats-chicken-on-meat-seller-s-table-video-emerges-and-trends-on.html>&amp;quot;The Baby is Innocent&amp;quot;: Little Boy Eats Chicken on Meat Seller's Table, Video Emerges and Trends on</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./17-thigh-high-boots-outfit-ideas-how-to-wear-thigh-high-boots.html>17 Thigh-High Boots Outfit Ideas | How to Wear Thigh-High Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./allegra-allison-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Allegra Allison Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bohemian-dressing-tips-how-to-know-if-you-have-bohemian-style.html>Bohemian Dressing Tips How to Know if You Have Bohemian Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-peach-trees-grow-in-chicago.html>Can Peach Trees Grow In Chicago</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
